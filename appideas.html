<h1 class="title">App Ideas</h1>

<p>Here is a list of ideas for open source apps to build with, or for
Webware. If you add an idea or comment, please sign your name and
leave a date stamp.  Many of the project ideas listed below will be
interrelated, so use cross-references where appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Extensions to the Webware and WebKit core (as opposed to other Kits or
stand-alone applications) belong on the `Wish List`_ page.</em></p>
<div class="section" id="rss-kit">
<h1>RSS kit</h1>
<p>I'm not sure what this would look like, but some object to facilitate
the collection of RSS feeds and embedding them into a web page.  I
guess there would be a few parts coded into a single class, or a
single class with helper classes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Configuration info: which site to connect to, how often to refresh.</p></li>
<li><p>Read and parse the RSS file at the specified interval.</p></li>
<li><p>Send some kind of &quot;observe me now&quot; signal to the object that's
serving the final output, so it can refresh itself.  Perhaps
Threading.Event or a port of Java's Observable/Observer interface
can help with this.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer the RSS data in a Python data structure to any routine that
asks for it.  Perhaps a method in the RSS-retrieval object can offer
this, or it can be in a well-known attribute somewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Have some boilerplate output objects that convert the RSS data into
HTML hyperlinks, for simple sites that want an &quot;out of the box&quot;
solution.  These classes should be scalable for adding cosmetic
enhancements via stylesheets or subclasses.</p></li>

<p>Just finished reading MiddleKit docs.  What are the chances of adding
a feature to MiddleKit that will read an XSD file, instead of CSV.
I'm more than willing to take the point on this ... since I'm bringing
it up, but I would like some help in some of the nitty-gritty details
of MiddleKit.  It's new to me.  Otherwise I'm just re-writing a whole
bunch of stuff that's already been done.</p>
<p>Thanks -- Ray Leyva - 20 Jan 2002</p>
<p>I know ambitious name, but it's an ambitious plan.  Generate simple
reusable objects that know how to render, replicate, and store
themselves.  I'm initially interested in creating objects that will
automagically tie themselves into a database once imported into a
framework, and immediately become available for data entry using
internally defined display / validation schemes</p>
<p>This came from my initial, and now semi-abandoned attempts to create a
single interface <a class="reference internal" href="#webwarereportkit">WebwareReportKit</a>.</p>
<p>I have so far created a validation, rendering, and reporting scheme.
I'm starting work on the storage components right now.  Don't want to
redo the MiddleKit stuff, but until I know where I'm going with the
general object layout I don't want to commit to any single OR mapping.</p>
<p>Things to note, the items I've completed work with XML / XSL / XSD,
and AFAIK the current best crop of those tools live in the java world.
I don't have the time to be able to both build this infrastructure,
and help out on the PyXML stuff.  Wish I did.  I use XmlRpc to tie
them together, of course this could be SOAP / CORBA or whatever remote
invocation procedure you like to use.</p>
<p>WebKit is the Application server that I'm basing the framework off of,
but I'm designing these objects with modularity in mind. IE : I don't
want to rule out using Java based App servers ... if push comes to
shove, and some client somewhere REALLY doesn't want to use Python /
Webware ;D</p>
<p>Is this of interest to anyone.  I'm trying to figure out the best way
to make this available ... I really want to give back to the
community.</p>
<p>All this because I figured out that for me to be able to print the
stuff from WebwareReportKit I would need to have a semi-intelligent
data-entry component first ... duh! ;D</p>
<p>PS : I'll get to that re-org sometime soon! :D
-- Ray Leyva - 19 Jan 2002</p>
<p>I have been working on (and then reworking over and over again...)
some XML tools, imaginatively known as XMLTools, which attempt to
provide mappings from database schemas to XML &quot;instances&quot; through
descriptions of those instances, which are themselves highly
simplified documents with the same purpose as XML Schema documents
(which is what I presume you mean by XSD).</p>
<p>The aim is to support XML instance validation, templating and storage
in various forms (such as in relational databases). An
object-relational mapping could be a consequence of this work, but
that doesn't interest me that much right now.</p>
<p>Eventually, I want to bring XMLForms back with its core replaced by
XMLTools, so that the main purpose of XMLForms is the integration with
Webware (and possibly other Web frameworks).</p>

<div class="section" id="webwarereportkit">
<h1>WebwareReportKit</h1>
<p>This would be more of a general compendium of standard reports that
can be generated.  For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Invoices</p></li>
<li><p>Bill Of Materials ( BOM )</p></li>
<li><p>Legal documents</p></li>
<li><p>Real Estate Documents</p></li>
<li><p>Generic process mandated documents.</p></li>
<li><p>Heck .. tax forms!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This could be used in conjunction with WebWare, and a database to
generate data driven reports.  It'd be a very useful component because
a great many applications require reporting functions.</p>
<p>PS: Are we putting newest ideas at the top, and oldest at the bottom?
If so I'd like to ask for general permission to re-order the older
inputs to reflect that.</p>
