<h1 class="title">Environment Variables</h1>

<p>Many Python scripts start with the following line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">#!/usr/bin/env python</pre>
<p>On UNIX-like systems, this instructs the operating system to find the <span class="docutils literal">python</span> executable according to the environment. To determine which version of Python gets run, just make sure that your <span class="docutils literal">PATH</span> environment variable is set up correctly.</p>
<p>If Python 2.0 is installed as <span class="docutils literal">/usr/local/bin/python</span> and Python 1.5.2 is installed as <span class="docutils literal">/usr/bin/python</span>, and you want to run Python 2.0, then you should make sure that <span class="docutils literal">/usr/local/bin</span> appears on your &quot;path&quot; before <span class="docutils literal">/usr/bin</span>. How and when this is done depends a lot on your system and how you want to work.</p>
<div class="section" id="setting-the-default-environment">
<h1>Setting the Default Environment</h1>
<p>Let's say you want to always use Python 2.0 as a particular user. This
means that you need to edit your shell's resource file so that when it
is started, it puts the directory in which Python 2.0 is found before
the directory in which Python 1.5.2 is found.</p>
<p>Check your system documentation for details of which file you should
edit and how you should edit it. Here's an example, though - for
<span class="docutils literal">bash</span> (the Bourne Again Shell), edit the <span class="docutils literal">.bashrc</span> file in your
home directory and add this at the end of the file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">export PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH}</pre>
<p>This assumes that you did install Python 2.0 in <span class="docutils literal">/usr/local</span> when
considering MultiplePythonVersions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-the-environment-for-appserver">
<h1>Setting the Environment for AppServer</h1>
<p>If you just want to run AppServer with a changed environment so that
only that program uses Python 2.0, and you are running <span class="docutils literal">bash</span>, you
can try this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH} ./AppServer</pre>
<p>Why not put this in a script:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">#!/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH} ./AppServer</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-you-should-not-do">
<h1>What You Should Not Do</h1>
<p>Don't be tempted to go round changing the first line of all Python
scripts to something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">#!/usr/bin/env python20</pre>
<p>If you do have Python 2.0 installed as something other than <span class="docutils literal">python</span>
then consider making a symbolic link from another directory to the
executable, like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /usr/bin/python20 python</pre>
<p>Now add that directory (in this case, <span class="docutils literal">/usr/local/bin</span>) to the start
of your &quot;path&quot;, like we did above.</p>
