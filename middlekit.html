<h1 class="title">MiddleKit</h1>

<p>MiddleKit (MK) is a component of Webware that provides for developing
your application with an object model which is in turn used for other
purposes.</p>
<p>In short, an object model is simply a listing of your classes and
their attributes including details such as type, name, min, max,
is-required, samples, delete rules, etc. Some would refer to this as
&quot;meta data&quot; or &quot;configuration&quot; or a &quot;class hierarchy description&quot;.</p>
<p>This Wiki page helps document some items that haven't made it to the
main docs yet, but are still important and often appear on the mailing
list.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-object-model-approach">
<h1>The Object Model Approach</h1>
<p>Originally, MK was developed purely as an &quot;object-relational mapper&quot;
or ORM, eg, software that maps objects to SQL databases. However,
experience shows that the object model can be used for many other
purposes including user interface.</p>
<p>This makes MK much more than just an ORM. Here is an excerpt from a
reply I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I use MiddleKit the more uses I have for the object model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>generating forms</p></li>
<li><p>generating object browsing pages</p></li>
<li><p>generating detailed views</p></li>
<li><p>generating sample data</p></li>
<li><p>generating SQL table definitions</p></li>
<li><p>generating runtime SQL</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that SQL now occupies less than half the list of uses for an
object model.</p>
<p>The pay off to using the object model is that it is very easy to
edit and all of the above things automagically work right after
the edit (with the occasional caveat).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another use for the object model is as a concise, precise document of
what data is being tracked and what their relationships, delete rules,
etc. are. The object model is much more clean to read and write than
either Python or SQL. I even use them in meetings with non-technical
clients.</p>
<p>MK will have its documentation revamped to reflect the object-model
focus and eventually receive additional code from a project of mine to
aid in the above tasks.</p>
<p>You can read the MK docs online at:</p>

<p>If you wish to begin using your object models in a generic fashion,
read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/Webware/MiddleKit/Docs/UsersGuide.html#MT_IteratingAttrs">this section</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="middlekit-does-not-force-you-to-use-a-funky-schema">
<h1>MiddleKit does <em>not</em> force you to use a &quot;funky&quot; schema</h1>
<p>Although it certainly encourages it. In order to simulate object
references and lists, as Python programmers are used to the terms,
MiddleKit has some interesting schema approaches. In particular, an
object reference is implemented as a 64-bit id split into 2 parts: the
class id and object id. This approach allows for the full power of
pointing to arbitrary objects. As a Python user you will never notice
this (MK hides it from you), but it doesn't jive well with other SQL
tools such as a SQL-oriented report generator.</p>
<p>If that is a problem for your projects, then do not use the &quot;obj ref&quot;
type described in the docs. Instead use whatever type you are using
for your SQL joins (such as &quot;int&quot; or &quot;string&quot;) and implement the
method yourself to fetch the object. You will still get the other MK
benefits such as an object model (which makes a nice form of concise
documentation), uniquing, autogeneration of UPDATEs and INSERTs, the
other object model uses described above, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-live-databases">
<h1>Updating live databases</h1>
<p>When you change your object model, your SQL schema changes as well. If
your database is already live and you can't discard the data, you have
to ALTER it into shape. I used to do this by hand, but <a class="reference external" href="geofftalvola.html">GeoffTalvola</a>
pointed me to mysqldiff which saves enormous effort. Before you use
it, read the important MiddleKit note on the <a class="reference external" href="mysqlthirdparty.html">MySQLThirdParty</a> page!</p>

<div class="section" id="middlekit-is-still-active">
<h1>MiddleKit is still active</h1>
<p>For unknown reasons, the question comes up periodically, &quot;Is MiddleKit
still being actively developed?&quot; The answer is &quot;yes&quot;. I use MiddleKit
in all my projects on a daily basis and still check in fixes and
enhancements. MK will only get bigger and better.</p>
<p>I think this might come up because MK is less active than WebKit for a
couple reasons. One, is that WebKit is more popular and hence has more
users peering at it, asking questions, submitting patches,
etc. Another is that MK is exceptionally stable with an excellent test
suite. While MK has a wish list like any other project, <em>stability</em>
and <em>testing</em> are already there. Frequent patches aren't required.</p>
