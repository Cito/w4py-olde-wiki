<p>an ecommerce shopping cart -- TavisRudd - 01 Nov 2001</p>
<p>eCommerce systems are funny, since they involve some simple
functionality for buying stuff, and some complicated functionality for
displaying and searching for items in the store -- which is actually a
ContentManagementSystem, though often mistakenly called simply a
&quot;shopping cart&quot;.</p>
<p>I have a crude little module that actually implements <em>just</em> the cart,
if anyone wants it. -- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 02 Nov 2001</p>
<p>This was always something that people were really interested in for
Zope, but which was never addressed satisfactorily. I used to
subscribe to the <em>very low traffic</em> ZCommerce list and every now and
again one would see newcomers posting questions like &quot;Where can I get
ZCommerce?&quot; and &quot;Is there a shopping cart for Zope?&quot; and they would
always go away disappointed. -- <a class="reference external" href="paulboddie.html">PaulBoddie</a> - 05 Nov 2001</p>

<h1>Implications?</h1>
<p>Why is there the avoidance of serious discussion on commercial implications of Wiki and related material?  An example would be for how we might implement it our (ASP) ecommerce software <a class="reference external" href="http://www.veracart.com">http://www.veracart.com</a>
