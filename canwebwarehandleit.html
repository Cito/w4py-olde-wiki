<h1 class="title">Can Webware Handle It?</h1>

<p>People often ask 'Is Webware ready for prime-time use?' or 'Can
Webware really handle it?' The answer is yes, but this is the wrong
question.</p>
<p>A better question would be 'can Webware help me build an application
that can reliably handle heavy loads?' Webware is not an application,
methodology, or recipe for success.  It is a development framework and
a collection of useful tools.  If you use the framework and tools
intelligently, and design your application well, then yes it will help
you build an application that can reliably handle heavy loads.  If you
use them poorly, or botch your application design, don't cross your
fingers.</p>
<p>An even better question is 'does Webware's architecture encourage and
facilitate effective application designs?'  I believe it does, for the
following reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>it uses Python: a well designed, modular, object-oriented, easy to
learn, and easy to maintain language</p></li>
<li><p>it is thoroughly object-oriented and encourages object-oriented
applications, unlike other frameworks like PHP and ColdFusion, which
tend to spawn a maze of spaghetti code and include files.</p></li>
<li><p>it is fairly simple to understand and very fast to develop with once
you've groked it.  This encourages rapid prototyping and testing,
and helps weed out bad designs early on.  Webware is a great fit for
software engineering methodologies such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xprogramming.com/what_is_xp.htm">eXtreme Programming</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html">Agile</a> methods.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>it doesn't dictate how you handle data storage and object
persistence.</p></li>
<li><p>it is extremely portable, allowing you great flexibility in your
choice of operating systems and other tools.</p></li>
<li><p>the Python and Webware user community is supportive, intelligent,
and experienced.  If you run into technical or conceptual hurdles,
ask some smart questions and you'll get some real gems of clear
thought in response.</p></li>
<li><p>objects (servlets, sessions, data caches) persist in memory between
requests. This can lead to huge performance gains over other
frameworks without in-memory object persistence.</p></li>
<li><p>it is extensible by design.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that Webware is only one part of your toolkit.
Non-trivial applications will rely on many other resources.  These
might include server and network hardware; operating system(s);
persistence mechanisms, such as filesystems and databases; web
servers(s); web caches, such as squid; external credit card
processors; shipping processors; and, of course, web browsers.  The
performance and reliability of your application will depend on how you
utilize these resources in conjunction with Webware.</p>
