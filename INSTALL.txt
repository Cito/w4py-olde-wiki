How to install this thing:

Get the entire Subversion repository::

    svn co svn://w4py.org

Get Webware CVS::

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/webware login
 
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/webware co Webware

I'll assume these were put in ``~/w4py.org`` and ``~/Webware``

Set up a new working directory::

    ~/Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir.py -c Wiki -d ~/w4py.org/Wiki/Context \
        -l ~/w4py.org/Wiki ~/WikiWorkDir

You may want to edit ``wiki.ini``, particularly in ``[wiki]`` the
``basepath`` setting, which is where all your Wikis will be stored.
This should be writable by the AppServer.  Also, for any domains there
should be a section, like ``[localhost]`` -- if you have multiple
domains that should serve the same wiki, use::

    [localhost]
    alias = canonical.domain.name

Also, you'll need to install htmlarea, from: 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/itools-htmlarea/HTMLArea-3.0-beta.zip?download

Or check here for the latest version: 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/itools-htmlarea/

Or maybe check out CVS:
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=69750

Once you've downloaded and unzipped, move it into
``w4py.org/Wiki/Context/htmlarea``.  Also, rename the file
``index.html`` to ``htmlarea_index.html`` (``index.html`` will serve
as an unfortunate catch-all if you don't do this).

Also install utidy from: http://utidylib.sourceforge.net/ , which in
turn requires libtidy and the Python ctypes library.  These are
available on Debian as ``libtidy0`` and ``python-ctypes`` (for other
OSes you are on your own).

Then you should be all set!
