How to install this thing:

Export the following parts from the Subversion repository::

    mkdir ~/w4py; cd ~/w4py
    svn export http://svn.w4py.org/Webware/trunk Webware
    svn export http://svn.w4py.org/Component/trunk/Component Webware/Component
    svn export http://svn.w4py.org/LoginKit/trunk/LoginKit Webware/LoginKit
    svn export http://svn.w4py.org/Wiki/trunk Wiki

You can also use "checkout" instead of "export"; this will allow you to later
quickly update these parts from the repository using "svn update".

Run the Webware installer::

    cd ~/w4py/Webware
    ./install.py

Set up a new WebKit working directory::

    ~/w4py/Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir.py \
        -c Wiki -d ~/w4py/Wiki/Context -l ~/w4py/Wiki ~/WikiWorkDir

Copy the standard ``wiki.ini`` file to the working directory::

    cp ~/w4py/Wiki/wiki.ini ~/WikiWorkDir/Configs

Customize ``~/WikiWorkDir/Configs/wiki.ini`` to fit your needs.
The ``basepath`` setting in the global section is where all your Wikis
will be stored. This should be writable by the AppServer.
Also, for any domains there should be a section, like ``[vhost(localhost)]``
-- if you have multiple domains that should serve the same wiki, use::

    [vhost(localhost)]
    canonical = canonical.domain.name

You must also customize the configuration files used by Webware.
Particularly, in ``~/WikiWorkDir/Configs/Application.config``, set::

    ExtraPathInfo = True

Also, set ``ErrorEmailServer`` and ``ErrorEmailHeaders``.
remove all Webware contexts which you don't want to use.
You shoudl also customize the app server using the configuration file
``~/WikiWorkDir/Configs/AppServer.config``.

There are several 3rd party tools you need to install:

First, you'll need to install htmlarea. You can download it here:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/itools-htmlarea/HTMLArea-3.0-rc1.zip?download

Or check here for the latest version:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/itools-htmlarea/
http://www.dynarch.com/projects/htmlarea/

Once you've downloaded and unzipped, move it into
``w4py.org/Wiki/Context/htmlarea``.  Rename the file ``index.html``
to ``htmlarea_index.html`` (``index.html`` will serve as an unfortunate
catch-all if you don't do this).

Second, you need to install utidy (http://utidylib.berlios.de),
which in turn requires tidy (http://tidy.sourceforge.net)
and the Python ctypes library (http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/).

Third, you need the docutils package (http://docutils.sourceforge.net)
for creating HTML from reStructuredText. You can download it here:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/docutils/docutils-0.3.9.tar.gz?download

Then you should be all set!

How to run this thing:

Start the app server::

    cd ~/WikiWorkDir
    ./AppServer

With the default settings in ``~/WikiWorkDir/Configs/AppServer.config``
You should now be able to access the Wiki at
http://localhost:8080
