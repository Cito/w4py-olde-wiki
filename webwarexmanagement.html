<h1 class="title">Webwar EX Management</h1>

<p>the last days there was a lot going on in <a class="reference external" href="appideas.html">AppIdeas</a>.  A lot of ideas
are about full fledged application while others consist of building
blocks for such application.  There is an agreement that
<a class="reference external" href="webwareusermanager.html">WebwareUserManager</a> is one of the most important building blocks.
Then there are a huge number of ideas that can be described as some
sort of Content/Document/Knowledge Management System. It might be
helpfull to define these ideas more rigorous as all of these terms are
used as &quot;buzzwords&quot; by a lot of marketing strategies.</p>
<p>I see these Applications (or modules) in a hierachical order:</p>
<p>Content Management:
* management of any data
* import/export of data
* authentication mechanism
* version control
* categorising data</p>
<p>Document Management:
* is a Content Management system
* the content consists of human readable files/documents
* has filter for import/export/view
* has workflow rules included
* has adapter for third party tools (for example text processing tools)
* has integrated search engine</p>
<p>Knowledge Management:
* is a Document Management System
* allows links
* includes something like RDF, Topic Maps,...
* includes expert system (?)</p>
<p>Of the proposed Apps, I'd see the following classification:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Content Management:</p></li>
<li><p>Document Management: <a class="reference external" href="webwaredocumentmanagementsystem.html">WebwareDocumentManagementSystem</a>, WebwareForum, WebwareMail,               WebwareSlash</p></li>
<li><p>Knowledge Management: WebwareVault, <a class="reference external" href="webwarewiki.html">WebwareWiki</a>, <a class="reference external" href="webwaresourceforge.html">WebwareSourceforge</a></p></li>
</ul>
