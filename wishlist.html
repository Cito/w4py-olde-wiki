<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Move ExtraPathInfo setting into servlets</a></h1>
<p>Currently, <a class="reference external" href="extrapathinfo.html">ExtraPathInfo</a> is a site-wide setting in
Configs/Application.py.  But it should really be set on a per-servlet
basis.  The servlet knows best whether it was designed to use
<a class="reference external" href="extrapathinfo.html">ExtraPathInfo</a>, and it's usually only a few servlets per application
that do.  <a class="reference external" href="extrapathinfo.html">ExtraPathInfo</a> can cause unexpected behavior with servlets
that are not specifically designed for it; e.g., see <a class="reference external" href="extrapathinfo.html">ExtraPathInfo</a>.</p>
<p>I propose a new HTTPServlet method, .wantExtraPathInfo_(), returning
false.  Servlets or intermediate classes can override it if they want
to provide this feature.  Thus, the first servlet found determines the
setting.  If it's false and there is extra path info, return a 404 Not
Found error, because we've reached the wrong servlet (perhaps an
index.py <a class="reference external" href="webkit.html">WebKit</a> implicitly inserted into the URL).</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Automatic use of local subclasses of major components</a></h1>
<p>It's been a planned feature of Webware for some time, but hasn't
actually been there: for Webware to use locally-developed subclasses
of major classes, like Application, HTTPRequest, etc.  Not only would
this help make Webware easier to upgrade -- since any local
enhancements would be clearly seperated -- but it would also make
experimentation much easier.  Non-core-Webware-developers could easily
make and distribute enhancements, and even core developers might
appreciate being able to distrubute controversial enhancements.</p>
<p>As these enhancements get wider use, we could see how they work in
real situations with a greater variety of developers (and styles).
Some will probably fall by the wayside, but others might show gretter
than expected popularity.</p>

<p>In the meantime:
On Tuesday 11 December 2001 12:28, Geoffrey Talvola</p>
<p>Chuck has written some nifty code to make it easy to replace class
methods after the fact.  It's in <a class="reference external" href="miscutils.html">MiscUtils</a>/MixIn.py.
You can put an __init__.py file into your context directory.  This
gets imported when the appserver starts up, and is therefore a
convenient place to put in code that needs to modify the core
Webware classes.  Something like this should work as the contents
of your __init__.py:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">###############################################
from MiscUtils.MixIn import MixIn
from WebKit.Session import Session

class SessionMixIn_:
    def expiring(self):
        # your implementation goes here

# Now inject the methods from SessionMixIn into Session
MixIn(Session, SessionMixin)
###############################################</pre>
<p>Until Webware has a better way to support custom classes, this is
probably the cleanest way to get what you want.</p>

<div class="section" id="single-vs-multiple-cgi-fields">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Single vs. multiple CGI fields</a></h1>
<p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.request().field()</span></span> (in HTTPRequest.py) currently returns
either a string or a list.  However, it causes major inconvenience.
If there is only one value for the field, it's a string.  If there are
multiple values, it's a list of strings.  This behavior is inherited
from Python's cgi.py module.  However, it's inconvenient for servlet
writers.  It requires the careful programmer to have to check the type
of _every_ field, even those that should always be one or the other,
or risk having the servlet crash if unexpected input is received.</p>
<p>How about adding a .fieldMulti() method that always returns a list?  A
single value would be coerced to <span class="docutils literal">[value]</span>, and a missing value to
<span class="docutils literal">[]</span>.  This would allow servlet writers to skip the list test.</p>
<p>Additionally, how about changing .field() and .fields() to never
return a list.  Instead, choose one of the values arbitrarily and
return it as a string.  This would also allow servlet writers to skip
the list test, in cases where they want only one value and don't care
which one it is.</p>
<p>If changing .field/s() as above is too backwards-incompatable a
change, how about leaving .field/s() alone and adding .fieldSingle()
with this behavior?</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="mikeorr.html">MikeOrr</a> - 30 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Consider proposing improvements in multiple value handling to Andrew
Kuchling for Python's <span class="docutils literal">cgi</span> module. Then other projects can get the
benefit of such improvements. Of course, Webware will still have its
own distinct approach for accessing field data, but we would at least
be able to take advantage of common work done in this area.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="paulboddie.html">PaulBoddie</a> - 03 Dec 2001</p>
<p>This isn't a substantial change, but rather a cleanup of semantics in
the interface.  IMHO, the interface in <span class="docutils literal">cgi</span> doesn't have
particularly clean semantics anyway, and tacking yet another thing
onto it won't help, and will just introduce yet another backwards
compatibility issue.</p>
<p>Personally, while I always use a function to make multi-select-fields
into lists, it's almost always a bug if I get a list when I didn't
expect it, and I'd rather have it raise an error than throw values
away.</p>

can be reloaded, but anything that has been imported from them will

<p>Both databases are as close as one can get to Open Source/Proprietary

that readers never block writers and writers never block

to databases that use table or row level locking. That both support
transactions with rollback, triggers, etc. and are fully ACID

<p>Webware would be more immediately useful if it had out-of-box support
for simultaneous access to established databases like Oracle, DB2,
PostgreSQL, etc. using pooled, persistent connections. This would
allow Webware to be used as a front-end to traditionally designed (as
in non-object-oriented, non-MiddleKit-style) schema. I know there's a
patch for this out there, but it does not seem to have made its way
into the CVS, nor has it solidified into some kind of plug-in or kit.</p>

<p>Sort of... to be truly useful, pooling needs to be part of

camps.  -- <a class="reference external" href="edmundlian.html">EdmundLian</a> - 05 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Would it be possible to integrate other database pooling systems into

<p>Another system to consider for integration with Webware is SQL
Relay. From the website: SQL Relay is a persistent database
connection pooling, proxying and load balancing system for Unix and
Linux supporting ODBC, Oracle, MySQL, mSQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, MS SQL
Server, IBM DB2, Interbase, Lago and SQLite with APIs for C, C++,
Perl, Perl-DBD, Python, Python-DB, Zope, PHP, Ruby, Ruby-DBD and Java,
command line clients, a GUI configuration tool and extensive
documentation. The APIs support advanced database operations such as
bind variables, multi-row fetches, client side result set caching and
suspended transactions. It is ideal for speeding up database-driven
web-based applications, accessing databases from unsupported
platforms, migrating between databases, distributing access to
replicated databases and throttling database access.</p>

<p>There should be a standard module for doing browser detection.
There's probably good PHP code to copy for this.  It should have
facilities for adding your own semantic browser-capability tests (for
instance, you should be able to ask, &quot;can the user's browser do X?&quot;
instead of just &quot;what browser is it&quot;, and then you can add the test
for what browser does what elsewhere (and grow that definition with
increased testing)</p>

<p>It would be nice if you could cache servlet output.  This should also

identicle GET variables, or add on session ID, or add on browser type,

URI and a key that would be generated by the Servlet (or
ServletFactory?) -- that key could include whatever information is
important.</p>
<p>Of course, with customizable times and the potential to expire these
caches prematurely.</p>
<p>This is also a feature request for <a class="reference external" href="cheetah.html">Cheetah</a> , and for caching of
parts of a page it would be essential.  However, caching the entire

<div class="section" id="gzipcompression">

<p>Webware should compress non-streamed output (and maybe streamed

with current browsers).  This shouldn't compress already-compressed
formats, like most image files.  This is a large saving for most sites
where bandwidth is at a greater premium than processing power.  The
implementation of this should be quite easy.</p>

<div class="section" id="scalabilityenhancements">
<h1><a class="reference internal" href="#scalabilityenhancements">ScalabilityEnhancements</a></h1>
<p>My favorite proposal to improve Webware's scalability is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Allow multiple app servers to run on different machines.  Each of
these app servers would be given a unique &quot;instance name&quot; specified
in a config file.  Session IDs would have the instance name encoded
into the session ID, for example an instance called Instance1 would
create session IDs such as &quot;Instance1_433048934&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Add options for the adapters to distribute requests to multiple
appserver back-ends.  Requests without a session ID would be
distributed randomly (or in round-robin fashion) to the different
appservers.  Requests with a session ID would be directed to the
particular appserver instance that originated the session, as
determined by extracting the instance name from the session ID.
This would be fairly easy to implement in the Python-based adapters
-- i.e. the CGI adapter and the mod_python adapter.  If the strategy
proves useful with those adapters, then it could be extended into
the mod_webkit adapter which would require more work.</p></li>
<li><p>The advantage of this strategy is that all session data is localized
to a particular appserver.  This is potentially much more scalable
than having to dedicate a central database server to store session
data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can have as many front-end web servers as you want,
load-balanced using any off-the-shelf load balancing solution.  And
you can have as many back-end Webware appservers as you need.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="geofftalvola.html">GeoffTalvola</a> - 03 Dec 2001</p>
<p><em>UPDATE</em>: In release 0.7 I've implemented a setting <a class="reference external" href="sessionprefix.html">SessionPrefix</a>
which can be used to add a machine-specific prefix to the session ID.
This can potentially be combined with some mod_rewrite magic to
achieve load balancing with session affinity in a slightly different
way than I've described above, but so far it's just an idea; I haven't
tried it.  When I have the time I'll actually test the technique and
write up a description of how to do it.  If anyone's curious to try
out the technique in the meantime, let me know and I'll try to
describe what I had in mind.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26">Add Browser Cancel Hooks</a></h1>
<p>I want to be able to trap when a browser cancels a transaction,
without having to dig into ThreadedAppServer.TASASStreamOut and
otherwise hack around :)</p>
<p>Basically, I have (potentially) long-running processes that acquire an
RLock, but I need to release that RLock if the process cancels. Right
now, I have no way to interrupt that process... the servlet continues
chugging in the background, even though the browser's stopped
listening.</p>
<p>I've seen the issue addressed in a mailing list posting, but couldn't
find anything more concrete than Geoff's suggestion about trapping the
EPIPE exception in TASASStreamOut.flush.</p>

<h1>Faster Deletion in <a class="reference external" href="middlekit.html">MiddleKit</a></h1>
<p>MiddleKit's deletion code currently is very slow in the way that it
checks for other objects that point to an object being deleted.
Basically, it pulls in entire tables instead of doing smarter SQL
SELECTs to bring in only rows that point to the object being deleted.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">Define Multiple Methods in PSP</a></h1>
<p>PSP currently only allows you to define a single method in a PSP file
using PSP syntax.  If you need to define additional methods, you have
to use the psp:method tag which only supports Python syntax.  It would
be nice if you could define multiple methods using PSP syntax.</p>
<p>There is a hackish way to do this using Python 2.1's nested scopes,
but it is a bit limited.  See <a class="reference external" href="methodsinpspsyntax.html">MethodsInPSPSyntax</a> for details.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29">Auto-Generate Better Docs With pydoc</a></h1>
<p>When you install Webware with &quot;python install.py&quot; it automatically
generates some class hierarchy documentation and some summary
documentation of all the classes.  But it doesn't include enough
information to be truly useful -- most notably, it doesn't include
docstrings.  We should improve this, perhaps by using pydoc in the
install script.</p>
<p>It was reported on the Webware mailing list that pydoc doesn't
actually work on Webware's source files for some reason.</p>

<p>There are numerous advantages to using distutils:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>users don't need to maintain a local copy of all the modules.</p></li>
<li><p>the core modules can be used easily by other frameworks</p></li>
<li><p>it can be packaged for Debian and other OS distros.</p></li>
<li><p>installs on Windows now make use of the GUI installer.</p></li>
