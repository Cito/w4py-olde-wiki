<h1 class="title">PostgreSQL</h1>

<p>Pro:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The most sophisticated of all the open source RDBMS. Has declarative
referential integrity constraints, triggers, stored procedures,
mature transaction support, multi-versioning concurrency control
(MVCC) and write-ahead logging for safety and excellent performance
under load.</p></li>
<li><p>More SQL-92 compliant than most RDBMS, including Oracle.</p></li>
<li><p>Stored procedures can be written in PL/pgSQL (a PL/SQL workalike),
PL/Tcl, PL/Perl, PL/Python (in 7.2).</p></li>
<li><p>Very easy to port between Oracle and PostgreSQL. Makes it easier to
migrate to Oracle if the customer wants it.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports hot backups, OLAP and ad-hoc queries easily since use of
MVCC means that readers never block writers, and writers never block
readers. This is also the reason why PostgreSQL and Oracle scale so
well. &lt;nop&gt;InterBase has MVCC, but has some internal design issues
that cripple its performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Well documented. No need to accumulate 1.5 ft of manuals and still
wonder how to do/manage something, like Oracle.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Con:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does not seem to have as widespread support amongst web developers,
probably because of the nonsense &lt;nop&gt;NuSphere puts out regarding
need for transactions, declarative referential integrity, etc. They
are backpeddling on transactions now though, and might eventually
acknowledge that the last 30 years of research into RDBMS systems is
actually right.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My perception on the lack of web developer support goes like this:
Virtual web host providers typically provide MySQL, but not
PostgreSQL because the former requires less CPU cycles (in fact
some providers have just outright said this), so many people using
such hosts learned MySQL because that was _the_ SQL database
available. Also, as a MySQL user (for the reason just stated) I
have never had any problems in _my_ projects and so never find the
time to convert to Postgres among my list of TO DOs. --

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I don't think it's an anti-PostgreSQL bias, just the ordinary hurdle
of not being the first, like wxWindows trying to bust into the
Tkinter scene.  Many MySQL developers (like me) want to switch to it
eventually (because it's &quot;better&quot; -- more features, more robust,
better OO, etc), but it's going against inertia.  I can add a MySQL
database like that &amp;lt;snaps fingers&amp;gt;, but every time I browse
the PostgreSQL manual I think, &quot;Aargh!  &amp;lt;recoil in horror&amp;gt; I
don't have time to read all this, choose among PostgreSQL's many
column types, or translate my queries!  Maybe later.&quot; --

<li><p>Does not have as many third party books and software tools as
MySQL. -- <a class="reference external" href="chuckesterbrook.html">ChuckEsterbrook</a> - 31 Dec 2001</p>
<ul>
<li><p>OTOH, you don't need anything except the excellent manuals if you
already know about RDBMS. If you don't, Bruce Momjian's book is a
good starter, and is freely downloadable at:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ca.postgresql.org/docs/awbook.html">http://www.ca.postgresql.org/docs/awbook.html</a> . There's also
<em>Practical PostgreSQL</em> which is also available at:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.info/">http://www.postgresql.info/</a> . Frankly though, I find that the
online manuals are more current since PostgreSQL is developing so
quickly. For third-party tools, well anything that can handle
SQL/ODBC will work. Crystal Reports, MS Excel, MS Access,
etc. Just use the ODBC driver. -- <a class="reference external" href="edmundlian.html">EdmundLian</a> - 31 Dec 2001</p></li>
<li><p>Well in that case, can you recommend a GUI client that works with
Postgres that is as nice as: <a class="reference external" href="http://anse.de/mysqlfront/">http://anse.de/mysqlfront/</a> , and a
tool like: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/~adam/computing/mysqldiff/">http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/~adam/computing/mysqldiff/</a> ? I
would have a hard time migrating to Postgres without the
latter. -- <a class="reference external" href="chuckesterbrook.html">ChuckEsterbrook</a> - 31 Dec 2001</p></li>
<li><p>There is <a class="reference external" href="http://ns.flex.ro/pgaccess/">http://ns.flex.ro/pgaccess/</a> for graphical
management/editing of tables, users, sequences functions,
etc. There is also
<a class="reference external" href="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/pgmonitor/projdisplay.php">http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/pgmonitor/projdisplay.php</a> for
monitoring the backend, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://pgadmin.postgresql.org/pgadmin2.php?ContentID=1">http://pgadmin.postgresql.org/pgadmin2.php?ContentID=1</a> for the
W95/8/NT client, which seems to be very nice and more capable than
pgaccess. pg_dump and pg_dumpall will extract a database into a
script file, which you can then diff. People use it for moving
databases and all the associated functions, etc. to another
installation. For most stuff, I actually just use psql (<a class="reference external" href="http://psql.sourceforge.net/">http://psql.sourceforge.net/</a>), the
terminal-based front-end since I can script it. -- <a class="reference external" href="edmundlian.html">EdmundLian</a> -

<p>I have outstanding questions regarding the so-called &quot;object oriented&quot;
features of PostgreSQL. I created <a class="reference external" href="postgresoofeatures.html">PostgresOOFeatures</a> for this.</p>
