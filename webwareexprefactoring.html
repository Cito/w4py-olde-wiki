<h1 class="title">Webware Exp. Refactoring</h1>

<p>I have been working on an experimental refactoring of Webware that
addresses most of the issues currently on the <a class="reference external" href="wishlist.html">WishList</a> and <a class="reference external" href="todo.html">ToDo</a>
list.  It is near feature complete, but needs extensive testing.</p>
<p>The CVS repository is available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=41909">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=41909</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a <a class="reference external" href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/expwebware/Webware/README">link</a> to the README file, which has alot more information.</p>

<p>JayLove has also been working on a 'mulitApplication' version of
WebKit.  It has slightly different aims than this, but is definitely
worth looking at if you're interested in how Webware could and should
be evolving.  I've lost the link, so send Jay an email if you're
interested.  -- TavisRudd - 27 Feb 2002</p>

<h1>Help Needed</h1>
<p>There's a few of us working on it behind the scenes, but when/if the
actual code merge takes place is up to Chuck.  Personally, I feel that
it's much easier to test the experimental code and tidy up the few
holes remaining than it would be to implement all the items on the
<a class="reference external" href="wishlist.html">WishList</a>/<a class="reference external" href="todo.html">Todo</a> using the Webware 0.6 codebase.  That said, Chuck
has an obligation as Webware's Benevolent Dictator to review all the
changes in the experimental code, before we merge and cut a
release. Either he has to do a manual code walkthrough/review or I and
the other people working on experimental code have to make the
automated test suite comprehensive enough to mitigate the need for a
tedious manual review by Chuck.  Either way, an _official_ merge is at
least a few months away.</p>
<p>Chuck wants to cut an official release in Feb.  I agree with him that
we should keep the official releases flowing with whatever we've got
rather than waiting for the next big thing.  Whether the release in
Feb is called 0.7 is up to him.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'm going to continue testing the experimental code,
encouraging people to join in on the testing, mirroring any new
additions to the official codebase, and backporting the smaller
changes in the experimental code to the official codebase wherever
possible.</p>
<p>Geoff has pointed out that the experimental code will only be ready
for serious consideration once we have some of the larger existing
applications running on it.  With that in mind, here's what people
can do to help out:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>MINIMAL EFFORT (1/2 hr)</dt>
<dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>download the cvs version of the code</p></li>
<li><p>read the README and see if what I've written makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p>follow the installation instructions and report any problems</p></li>
<li><p>run the automated test suite on their platform ... reporting any problems or further documentation needed along the way</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>MODERATE EFFORT (a few hours to a few days)</dt>
<dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>create a small test application, or try porting their existing applications ... reporting any problems or further documentation needed along the way</p></li>
<li><p>add more test cases to the automated test suite.  This is very easy.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>EXTRA EFFORT (up to you)</dt>
<dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>manually review the code and/or search for any ToDo comments that begin with &#64;&#64;.</p></li>
<li><p>tackle items on the ToDo/WishList on the Wiki site or in the experimental code's README file.</p></li>
<li><p>Write documentation/howtos</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There's two mailing lists set up for the experimental code: one for
reporting problems and discussing issues and another for automated
CVS notifications. <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=41909">http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=41909</a>.  Please report bugs
and direct questions to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:expwebware-devel&#64;lists.sf.net">expwebware-devel&#64;lists.sf.net</a> rather than to
the regular webware email lists.  Sending stuff to the regular lists will
just confuse people who aren't aware of this refactoring effort.</p>
<p>For those people who want to get their feet wet with the code, send
me a message if you want CVS write access or send patches to the
expwebware-devel email list.</p>
