<h1 class="title">Log Messages</h1>

<p>Webware has a logging facility you can use for basic debugging.</p>
<p>If you are running the application server in OneShot mode, output of
self.log('Message') calls will appear toward the very bottom of the
page if you have the showconsole parameter set to 1 in
conf/oneshot.conf. Otherwise, the log messages will appear in the
Webware console.</p>
<p>FYI, the logging method is defined in WebKit.Servlet, and this is
inherited by HTTPServlet, and then by Page. So, you should have this
method available pretty much everywhere, unless it was over-ridden
accidentally.</p>

<p>I'd also recommend Sacha's <a class="reference external" href="loggingkit.html">LoggingKit</a>.  It's very well designed and
quite flexible.</p>

<p>More information from BenParker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The constant AppServer will write to stdout, which could be the
console, or you could redirect it to a file, which is what most
people do. Then you can &quot;tail -f&quot; the file to monitor the output
via the console, and still have a record of it in the file.  You
could also pipe the output to a logging program instead of just
appending straight to a file.</p>
<p>OneShot errors always appear in our apache error logs.  Apache
runs the CGI process, so error output from the process feeds back
into Apache.  Standard &quot;print ...&quot; messages appear at the bottom
of every OneShot page as long as you have verbose=1 in your
OneShot config file; the stdout is captured by the OneShotAdapter
I believe ... maybe the OneShotAppServer...</p>

<p>If this PEP becomes part of the core (which seems likely), this could
be the basis for logging: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0282.html">PEP 282</a></p>
