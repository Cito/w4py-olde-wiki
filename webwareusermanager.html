<p><em>NOTE</em></p>
<p>A Webware <a class="reference external" href="subproject.html">SubProject</a> has now been spawned from this topic.  See
<a class="reference external" href="userhandlingproj.html">UserHandlingProj</a> for more on designing and implementing a flexible
framework for handling user authentication and authorization in
Webware applications. This page is home for discussion about
<a class="reference external" href="webwareusermanager.html">WebwareUserManager</a>, an application built on top of that framework to
help manage users and groups.</p>

<p>I think permissions should be considered something of a different
issue -- ACLs being traditional at this point, but not always
appropriate. They are closely tied to the system's notion of a an
object and the granularity of permissions.</p>
<p>I myself have been thinking about a more OO way of doing
permissions -- most of the ways seem to be based on static data
structures with explicit algorithms: it's not possible, for
instance, to say &quot;anyone can do action X if someone with permission
Y requested that they do it&quot; -- you can make the request also grant
the permission, but the algorithm itself is external to the
security system.  You can't, for instance, retroactively change
those permissions around, because the actions (the request) have
already passed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not sure where I'm going with that idea, but it might
only be to say that figuring out permissions is distinct from
managing users and their roles/groups, and probably more
complicated.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 20 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Zope has a robust but (for some applications) overly complex security
system: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zope.org/Documentation/ZDG/Security.stx">http://www.zope.org/Documentation/ZDG/Security.stx</a> .</p>
<p>We're leaving out the Zope term &quot;role&quot; because it ambiguously overlaps
with our term &quot;group&quot;.  We're also leaving out Zope's &quot;Proxy Roles&quot;
(analagous to Set-UID programs, or allowing a user to acquire extra
permissions in certain circumstances.)</p>
<p>Our &quot;ownership&quot; is different than Zope's.  What Zope calls ownership
was added to Zope in 2000 to plug a security hole related to
through-the-web editing and proxy roles.  For us, 'owner' means the
user(s) who may reassign the permissions of a particular resource.</p>
<p>As far as user interface, Zope uses one screen with a table of
permisions down the left and roles along the top, another screen for
linking groups to roles, and the user screen for assigning users to
groups.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="mikeorr.html">MikeOrr</a> - 22 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Let's scrap the term 'role' completely, and only use the terms of
users, groups, actions and permissions.  Where 'actions' are things
like view, edit, etc. and permissions are the authorization for
particular users and groups to be able to perform those actions on an
object.  An application designer should be able to define custom
actions. 'roles' implies a strict connection between 'groups' and
particular 'actions', which is not desirable.  The permissions system
in Windows NT and Novell Netware are good models.</p>
<p>-- TavisRudd - 20 Nov 2001</p>
<p>I don't know what Novell uses -- it seemed very fine-grained -- but I
don't particularly like NT.  The way permissions combined seemed very
strange -- for instance, if you have Everyone: Deny All, then other
more permissive permissions would be meaningless.  This seems
backwards, and overall very confusing.  If you want to look at a
particular ACL implementation -- ACLs are hardly novel, after all -- I
think it should be possible to find something better than NT.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 20 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Novell uses a modified version of LDAP to power it's NDS
authentication system.  Couldn't we utilize OpenLDAP as a basis?</p>
<p>-- RayLeyva - 20 Nov 2001</p>
<p>With all this talk of users, groups, roles and so on, it's important
not to forget applications where the concept of a user might be
interesting, but where the relationships between users and actions are
completely different (they could be determined by their position in an
organisation, for example) and are irrelevant to the ownership of
Webware resources (being relevant instead to the data manipulated by
such resources).</p>
<p>I have been thinking a bit about authentication and access in some
recent experiments and I think it would be nice if one could have a
layer where access checks are implemented separately from normal
servlet code. In <a class="reference external" href="xmlforms.html">XmlForms</a> I would consider adding an <span class="docutils literal">access</span>
section to each definition which can validate a user's credentials
according to an arbitrary validation function, and should the
validation fail, the user would be directed to another resource either
to get authenticated or to be told what went wrong.</p>
<p>These validation functions might well use a lot of
application-specific logic, but they could benefit from simple,
generic user support in Webware. One of the things about Zope which
seemed either badly explained or badly designed was the tight binding
between users and what Zope wanted users for. Clearly, Zope supports
user sessions for itself, but then people mention that it doesn't
support user sessions for Zope-based applications without add-on
products being present to provide such sessions.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="paulboddie.html">PaulBoddie</a> - 21 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Here are examples of group structures appropriate to different
applications:</p>
<p>(A) Unprivileged user, logged-in user, content manager.  The last may
be factored out if the app doesn't allow through-the-web managing.
The first may be factored out if user identification isn't necessary
for these actions: simply put an if-anonymous-user branch in each
servlet.  If you're left with only one group (logged-in user), maybe
you won't use most of this kit/package.</p>
<p>(B) Unprivileged user (may read some content and post to forums),
privileged user (may read all content and post to forums), content
manager (may add/edit articles; e.g., &quot;pages&quot;), app manager (may
change the app's look or do more programmingish stuff).  All this is
separate from the anonymous user, which has his own default
permissions.</p>
<p>Only some sites will have a web management interface.  Even fewer will
allow non-managers to modify editorial content (&quot;articles&quot;, as opposed
to forum postings or user-submitted entries) through the web.
<a class="reference external" href="webwareusermanager.html">WebwareUserManager</a> should scale down to these sites and not require
unnecessary complexity.  Complexity should be added only at the point
it's needed.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="mikeorr.html">MikeOrr</a> - 22 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Remember, this discussion is about a UserManagement system that can be
used for the various application ideas on the <a class="reference external" href="appideas.html">AppIdeas</a> wiki page.
Most of those would fall into the 'large, complex' category.  We would
really need to discuss the permissions system in the context of each
of those applications.  But as none of them exist let's focus on
authentication for now.</p>
<p>What are people using at the moment to do their authentication?</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>for authentication we only need to think in terms of users</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a summary of the important questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At what stage in the request-response cycle does authentication take
place (Adapter, Application, or Servlet)?  Doing it at the Adapter
level means we can use the same mechanism to protect content that
isn't served via <a class="reference external" href="webkit.html">WebKit</a>. Doing it at the Application level means
that we can also protect static content that is served via
<a class="reference external" href="webkit.html">WebKit</a>. Doing it at the Servlet level means that we can only
protect servlets.</p></li>
<li><p>are we going to use an identifier in the session or a separate
authentication cookie as is suggested in the two papers I listed
below?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that we use sessions to store the authentication details,
how do we make sessions work with/without cookies?  Extend this to
protecting static content via <a class="reference external" href="webkit.html">WebKit</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>How do we store authentication information in the user session?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we guard against session hijacking?</p></li>
<li><p>How are password's stored internally? plain or hashed?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we interface with arbitrary stores of user information and
passwords (flat-file, BSD-DB, ZODB, relational database, LDAP, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>When Webware makes the shift to a multi-application framework, does
authentfication span applications?</p></li>
<li><p>How do we make the authentication system fall-back to a semi-secure
mechanism (e.g. md5 hashes via javascript) when SSL isn't available.</p></li>
<li><p>Do we want to enable some sort of IP filtering or automatic
IP-userID mapping?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we going to block brute-force dictionary attacks with a failed
login time-out mechanism?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we going to worry about multi-machine failover support?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's some excellent overviews of the issues involved and the schemes available:

<p>-- TavisRudd - 22 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Tavis said <a class="reference external" href="webwareusermanager.html">WebwareUserManager</a> (WUM) is meant for complex apps such as
those on the <a class="reference external" href="appideas.html">AppIdeas</a> page.  But it would be better to have a system
that scales up to those applications and also down to simpler
applications that don't need all its features.  Because even the
simplest application (with one group) may want some features, such as
a registration screen and password-recovery screen.  And maybe this
simple application will one day become more complex and require some
features it didn't previously.  Then you can simply activate the
features rather than porting the application to WUM.</p>
<p>One of the goals mentioned above was seamless reauthentication.  That
is, when the user hits an unauthorized page, the system prompts him to
login, then retries the original request.  Zope does this through an
Unauthorized exception, which Zope automatically catches and does the
login prompting and retrying.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="mikeorr.html">MikeOrr</a> - 23 Nov 2001</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PasswordRecovery</p></li>
<li><p>Lost-password recovery mechanisms:</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;mail me my password&quot; button (to my registered address).</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;mail me a new password&quot; button.</p></li>
<li><p>challenge question and answer, preselected during registration.  We
can offer a single question, a choice of questions, or a
user-provided question.  To reassure paranoid users, the question
should not relate to any info that could be (mis)used to identify
the user or place them in a marketing category.  &quot;Pet's name&quot; is
safe; &quot;favorite sports team&quot; is questionable; &quot;birthdate&quot; and
&quot;mother's maiden name&quot; is unacceptable.  (Disadvantage: user may not
want to come up with and memorize a question/answer.)</p></li>
<li><p>mail user a randomized URL, valid only for 30 minutes, where she can
choose a new password.  (Tavis prefers this, and Mike thinks it may
offer a fair compromise between security and convenience.)  -- I am
absolutely against mailing passwords.  -- TavisRudd - 23 Nov 2001</p></li>
</ul>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="mikeorr.html">MikeOrr</a> - 22 Nov 2001</p>
<p>One of the sites I used also did this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>send a new, generated password by postal mail to the
user. Unfortunately, despite attempting to select &quot;send by e-mail&quot;,
the application decided to use postal mail instead, but I did get a
letter a few days later with the password in it. :-) Is this a
justification for the establishment of a PostKit component? ;-)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Something which I just realised: I have been following this page's
progress using the WebChanges page, but the categorisation and naming
of what is being discussed seems wrong. As one of the <a class="reference external" href="appideas.html">AppIdeas</a> which
discusses a <a class="reference external" href="webwareusermanager.html">WebwareUserManager</a>, it seems to suggest an application
which provides easy administration of user details, rather than a
framework for the identification and authentication of
users. Shouldn't we set up a <a class="reference external" href="wishlist.html">WishList</a> entry concerning sessions and
users, or at least refer to this as &quot;WebwareUserHandling&quot;?</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="paulboddie.html">PaulBoddie</a> - 23 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Paul, you're right.  This core of this is a system component rather
than an application. However, I'd like to build an application for
managing users on top of the framework.</p>
