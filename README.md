# Ye Olde Webware for Python Wiki

This GitHub repository serves as an archive for both the [code](https://github.com/Cito/w4py-olde-wiki/tree/master)
and the [content](https://cito.github.io/w4py-olde-wiki/) of the old Webware for Python Wiki.

Note that [Webware for Python](https://cito.github.io/w4py) is still maintained, but this Wiki
has been frozen in 2010 and will not be updated any more.
