<h1 class="title">Webware Hosting</h1>

<p><em>What you need in a Host:</em></p>
<p>You need Python installed, but you can do that yourself as long as you
have a C compiler available.</p>
<p>The real issue is being able to have long-running processes.  Most
commercial hosts don't allow, or otherwise hinder long-running
processes -- in Webware's case, the <a class="reference external" href="appserver.html">AppServer</a>.  Some hosts kill
processes that run too long, so you'll want to ask about that.</p>
<p>You also want mod_rewrite installed, as that's fairly important for
cleaning up the URL and if you wanted to serve the root page from
Webware (see <a class="reference external" href="modrewriterecipes.html">ModRewriteRecipes</a>).  You can control mod_rewrite from an
.htaccess file.</p>
<p>You'll be able to use the C-based CGI adapter, since you probably
can't install mod_webkit.  But that should be fine.</p>
<p>That pretty much covers it.  There isn't a list of hosts that support
this.  Most do not, but I imagine there's a healthy minority who
probably would.  If you find some, please post them here.  Some of the
places that host Zope (but not necessarily as their primary business)
may very well support Webware, as they are similar (from the host's
perspective).</p>

<p><em>Hosts:</em></p>
<p>Please list any hosts you have used Webware on, and any experiences
you may have had.  Prices are also useful.</p>
<p>Superb.net: I've used their SPS server, ~$80/mo for a virtual private
server (looks like a dedicated server, but is actually shared).
Reliability isn't as good as I'd like, but I have complete control
over the environment.  Installing Webware is easy. -- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 15

<p>fionet.com: A german hoster. I am working regularly on their servers. They have Debian
Linux and you can get python cgi and your own WebWare tree preinstalled as well as
ssh access and mySQL. Its fine for complex projects and hosting prices
that include a WebWare installation start at â‚¬25. They have no real home
page but can be reached via mail to service[AT]fionet.com. --

<p>cornerhost.com: hosts zunzun.com, excellent personal support, very
Python-friendly, mod_webkit installed for Apache which gives
zunzun.com quite snappy response times, several different hosting
plans, $500/yr is the one I use as it is literally unlimited in
bandwidth, CPU usage, or disk space.  HIGHLY recommended.  -- James
Phillips 16 March 2003</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.etria.com">Etria.com</a>: My company (along with Brian Skahan).  We offer Webware
hosting via mod_webkit and Apache2.  Things are not setup yet, but if
someone wants the service we will juggle our priorities to get it
done.  See website for rates. -- TomVonSchwerdtner - 02 Apr 2003</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://python-hosting.com/">Python-Hosting.com</a>: One of the only hosts I've run across that
explicitly offer <a class="reference external" href="http://python-hosting.com/webware">Webware hosting.</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.linode.com">linode.com</a> : Uses User Mode Linux. Root Access $20/mo gets you 1GB
Disk Space, 64MB RAM, 25GB monthly transfer. Very nice setup.  --
Randall Smith - 19 July 2003</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://python-hosting.us/">Python-Hosting.us</a>: For the latest and greatest python support.
A turnkey python and <a class="reference external" href="http://python-hosting.us/webware/">webware-specific</a> solution -- <a class="reference external" href="terrelshumway.html">TerrelShumway</a> -

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.web-hosting-url.com/virtual-dedicated-server-hosting.html">web-hosting-url.com</a>: Sphera Virtual Dedicated Server (VDS). Roll-your-own setup, very reliable... and the price is right!  -- Luc Chase - 1 July 2004</p>
<p>Quantact.com: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.quantact.com/">http://www.quantact.com/</a>
User Mode Linux VPS 3G Disk 64M Ram 20G Bandwidth $14.99 very configurable. Discounts for Open Source Developers. -- Tim Doyle - October 2004</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://openhosting.com">openhosting.com</a>: VPS for $27/month.  Run by the author of mod_python.  I haven't been using it very long, but so far so good.  -- Donovan Eastman - March 2005</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.anchor.net.au">http://www.anchor.net.au</a>: 10MB account on shared Linux server for $A198/year.  Good connectivity for Australian users.  I was able to set up a cut down WebKit 0.8.1 in 3MB of its space.   Allows CRON and ssh w/Python 2.2.  -- OliverBock - August 2005</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.grokthis.net/">GrokThis.net</a>: Not a VDS, its better.  Supporting CGI, FastCGI, and mod_python at reasonable rates.  Faster and more affordable than a VDS, with access to your own dedicated web service process and all of its configuration files.</p>
