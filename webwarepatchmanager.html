<p>Use Subversion ( <a class="reference external" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a> ) , when it is ready.</p>
<p>I would say, &quot;use CVS&quot;, but it will never be ready, because the
backend storage model does not support sandboxes (many short-lived
experimental branches) well.</p>
<p>Why does Subversion work?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>secure: branching/merging are almost trivial. rejecting/accepting a
patch is very easy.</p></li>
<li><p>barrier to entry: actually lower than with web/email-based
interface.</p></li>
<li><p>a developer with the commitment/skill level to contribute useful
patches will probably already have the tools installed</p></li>
<li><p>the tools create a valid patch automatically (no fiddling with diff
options) based on current development (not what the person
downloaded a week ago when he started the project)</p></li>
<li><p>other developers can immediately (and easily) apply the patch and
evaluate it.</p></li>
<li><p>the automated build/test procedure can see and verify the change
very quickly, rather than waiting for a harried developer to
download the patch from the clunky web interface and apply it to
code that has changed four times in the week since the patch was
created.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(all of these points except the first also apply to CVS.)</p>
<p>Combined with a Roundup discussion, this is a killer tool with very
useful history features.</p>
<p>Bonus: subversion uses <a class="reference external" href="webdav.html">WebDAV</a> as its native network protocol, so you
get a simple browser interface for free.</p>
