<h1 class="title">Submitting Patches</h1>

<p>Read the <a class="reference external" href="http://webware.sourceforge.net/Webware/Docs/StyleGuidelines.html">Webware Style Guidelines</a>, and try to follow them when making your
changes.</p>
<p>Create a patch against the latest SVN (using <span class="docutils literal">svn diff</span>) and submit it on
<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/webware">Webware's SourceForge page</a>.  Then send email to the webware-devel
list.</p>
<p>It would be highly appreciated also if you could modify the <a class="reference external" href="webkit.html">WebKit</a>
documentation in the appropriate places to describe the new patch.
The thing you're patching may be currently undocumented, in which case
you're not expected to write full documentation unless you feel like
it :-)</p>
<p>At the very least, please include in the patch submission a sentence
or two describing the patch that could be pasted into the release
notes.</p>
<p>And if you've added new settings to Application.config or
AppServer.config, please edit the Configuration Guide to describe
the new settings, and include the diff in your patch.</p>

<p>And remember to test your patch right before you sumbit it so you
don't accidentally submit syntax errors and the like along with your
patch (not that I've ever done something so silly ;).</p>
<p>-- TavisRudd - 20 Mar 2002</p>
<p>And if you have more than one distinct enhancement and/or fix, try to
make individual patches rather than one monolithic patch. That makes
it easier for us to absorb the contributions.</p>
