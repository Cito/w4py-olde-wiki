<p>(This App now exists: <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.colorstudy.net">http://wiki.colorstudy.net</a> )</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="otherwikisfeatures.html">OtherWikisFeatures</a> -- cool things found elsewhere that we should
steal^H^H^H^H^Hbe inspired by.</p>
<p>Zope has ZWiki, why don't we have a WikiKit? We could write one from
scratch or make a stub interface to one of the existing Python wikis
(Twiki is working well here; there's also PikiPiki, MoinMoin,
PikiePikie, Pyle). Using an existing one would, of course, allow us
to leverage its features and development, but it requires kludging
since none of the existing wikis were intended to be embedded thus.
We could also tackle some existing problems in the wiki world, such as
providing an XML DTD as a common base format for converting one wiki
server's syntax to another's, and scripts for importing wiki data
to/from other server's data stores.</p>

</ul>
<p>If we go ahead and make this, the backend should be completely
independent of Webware. Only the interface should be tied to it.</p>
<p>Also, I prefer the names <a class="reference external" href="webwarewiki.html">WebwareWiki</a> and WWiki to WikiKit, but
that's probably because I dislike the *kit naming scheme as whole.</p>
<p>-- TavisRudd - 05 Nov 2001</p>
<p>If you seperate out the concepts, it can be a more
managable/reusable/aproachable project.</p>
<p>For instance, there is the WikiSyntax, which is similar to
StructuredText -- but it's only <em>societally</em> important to the Wiki,
not technically.  Some Wikis use straight HTML anyway.</p>
<p>Then there's the editing interface.  This is vaguely what I did in
ComfyEdit , which is more notable to say that part isn't that hard
either.  Most Wikis that aren't built on object databases of some sort
are actually just a set of text files that get edited.  TWiki is
clever enough to add RCS recording to that process as well -- but then
it's just a bunch of <span class="docutils literal">.txt</span> and <span class="docutils literal">.txt,v</span> files.</p>
<p>The third important part of a Wiki is the naming and linking
mechanism.  Personally, I like the notion of named links ala Wiki much
better than HREFs for internal links anyway.  The WikiName syntax can
be awkard, but the essential flat namespace could be mapped to from
different syntaxes -- that's more a text formating issue.</p>
<p>Each of these really has a lot of value on its own.  Easy text editing
is nice (maybe an appropriate format for WebwareDocumentation even).
Editing pages/files/objects is generally useful -- it could even be
considered a subset of something that includes FTP and <a class="reference external" href="webdav.html">WebDav</a>.  The
named links are also a very interesting linking idea (including
backlinks); it provides an interesting alternative to hierarchical
namespaces.</p>
<p>The lesson of WikiWiki isn't so much one of cool technologies -- it's
of putting together a set of useful ideas into something that is much
more than its parts.  There might be other combinations that lead to
other cool stuff -- if the parts are all orthogonal, we might stumble
on something great.</p>

<p>Here's some ideas for possible enhancements to existing Wikis such as
TWiki:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>firm up the StructuredText syntax (see
<a class="reference external" href="http://structuredtext.sf.net">http://structuredtext.sf.net</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>auto-syntax coloring of code listings (starting with Python, but
extending to other langs)</p></li>
<li><p>multi-topic search and replace tool</p></li>
<li><p>make it possible to have <a class="reference external" href="nonwebinterfaces.html">non-web interfaces</a>, along the same lines as
<a class="reference external" href="webdav.html">WebDav</a>.  Think of a WikiMode for Emacs! (already kind of
possible, seeing as Emacs has a web browser and speaks HTTP)</p></li>
<li><p>make it possible for the Wiki to understand several different
WikiSyntax styles</p></li>
<li><p>provide conversion and import tools, like Mike suggested above</p></li>
<li><p>make the web interface prettier and more functional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>edit-box that spans 90% of window width rather than a fixed width
_(Not possible, as far as I know)_</p></li>
<li><p>provide a more functional WebChanges page, or simply use a
WebCVS script</p></li>
<li><p>make the homepage of the Wiki prettier (TWiki's is rather ugly)
_(Simply because I haven't changed the templates -- not really
TWiki's fault)_</p></li>
<li><p>make it possible to roll-back changes (to an abritrary
rev. number) _(You can do this in TWiki)_</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>make it possible to use Subversion rather than CVS. _(Why? What is
Subversion?)_</p></li>
<li><p>extend TWiki's concept of 'webs' to allow nesting of 'webs' (like
Python's package structure.  ... blends the flat namespace of
traditional Wiki's with a hierarchical structure like Zope's
folders.</p></li>
<li><p>use something other than basic HTTP authentification for logging in.</p></li>
<li><p>allow tight integration with the other <a class="reference external" href="appideas.html">AppIdeas</a> that we've floated.
In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>WebwareZope / <a class="reference external" href="webwaresourceforge.html">WebwareSourceforge</a> -- huge potential here!</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="webwarelistarchive.html">WebwareListArchive</a></p></li>
<li><p>WebwareForum</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="webwarevaults.html">WebwareVaults</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="pythonwebstats.html">PythonWebStats</a></p></li>
<li><p>WebwareSlash</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>make it possible to embed editable regions in otherwise
write-protected wiki pages (There's another Wiki that does this, but
I can't remember which one)</p></li>
<li><p>make it possible to view/preview the contents of one WikiTopic
inside another.  This would be enabled via either a button on each
topic or a user setting.  The view/preview bit could be done
in-place or via a separate frame (preferable).  Think of it like the
view pane in an email client.  Each WikiName link would be followed
by a * or some other symbol when this feature was active.  Clicking
on the * would display the contents of that WikiName in the view
frame.</p></li>
<li><p>make it possible to use Templates (like Cheetah's object-orientated
ones) for individual WikiTopics.</p></li>
<li><p>make it possible to drop in 'user interface components' such as
ready built forms, surveys, etc. into a WikiTopic</p></li>
<li><p>make it possible to store custom meta-informational fields about
WikiTopics.</p></li>
</ul>
