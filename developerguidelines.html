<h1 class="title">Developer Guidelines</h1>

<p>Here are some guidelines for Webware Developers:</p>
<div class="section" id="design">
<h1>Design</h1>
<p>If your change is non-backward-compatible or involves design
considerations, please discuss it on the webware-devel list before
checking it in (and preferably before implementing it!).  Your ideas
are probably good, but someone else on the list may come up with
better ones!</p>
<p>Following Python's development model, Webware also has a BDFL.  Chuck
Esterbrook is Webware's BDFL.  As such, he has final say over Webware
design issues and if he makes a pronouncement, please obey it.</p>
<p>Jay and Geoff can also make pronouncements if Chuck isn't available or
if they are better qualified to decide on whatever issue is at hand.
But pronouncements from Jay or Geoff are overruled by a pronouncement
from the BDFL.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coding">
<h1>Coding</h1>
<p>Follow the Webware Style Guidelines.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/Docs/StyleGuidelines.html">http://www.webwareforpython.org/Docs/StyleGuidelines.html</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Please test before checking in changes.  If the component you are
modifying has a test suite, please add a test case to the test suite
if appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Please update the Release Notes.  If a new feature has been added,
please update the User's Guide.  If a new setting has been added,
please update the Configuration Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="becoming-a-webware-developer">
<h1>Becoming a Webware Developer</h1>
<p>If you agree to abide by the rules listed above and you want SVN write
access, send an email to Chuck Esterbrook and Geoff Talvola.  You
should let them know what it is you plan to do with SVN -- fix bugs,
improve the docs, add new features, write a regression test suite, or
whatever.  Also, if you can show evidence of one or more of these:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Previous history of writing quality Webware patches</p></li>
<li><p>Previous history of writing quality 3rd-party extensions to Webware</p></li>
<li><p>Previous history of writing quality open-source Python code</p></li>
<li><p>Or any other evidence that you'll be a good addition to the Webware team</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then Chuck or Geoff will probably give you write access.</p>
