<p>(moved from <a class="reference external" href="appideas.html">AppIdeas</a>)</p>
<p>This is a follow up to a topic <a class="reference external" href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge_/3854/0/7099282/">thread</a> from the mailing list.</p>
<p>Looking to create a Webware based Groupware application.  It should
include email, and calendaring functions.  There's a million of them
out there, but not for Webware ;D</p>
<p>With this as a starting point I would like to eventually get to
something like a WyattERP (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wyatt-erp.com">http://www.wyatt-erp.com</a>, it's hosted on
<a class="reference external" href="sourceforge.html">SourceForge</a>), except ASP and Python/WebWare based.</p>
<p>-- RayLeyva - 17 Nov 2001</p>
<p>I think for a heavy-use application like WyattERP you need a pretty
good interface -- I'm not sure a normal HTML/HTTP interface is it
(though maybe if you used browser extensions heavily).  For things
like data entry and high-feedback interfaces, HTTP/HTML/ASP sucks :-(</p>
<p>But maybe if certain pieces of the application use custom local
program, it might work better (to reference the next idea).</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 19 Nov 2001</p>
<p>This idea ties in fairly closely with many of the other ideas listed
above.  The core of all these applications would the
authenfication/authorization system. Maybe we should start with that.
I haven't used <a class="reference external" href="userkit.html">UserKit</a> so I'm not sure if it is up to scratch.  The
recent discussions about non-cookie based session management are
related to this as well.</p>
<p>Once a flexible authenfication/authorization system is in place, it
would make sense to design a 'component/html-widget' system that
allows multiple UI components to be used on a single page without
namespace clashes, just as you can place multiple complex widgets on a
GUI form and not have to worry about conflicts between them.  Most
html-based applications I've seen fail miserably in this respect.  It
should be possible to drop a calender 'component' into a page that
already contains other components, or even other calendar components.
ASP.net's server controls seem to do this quite well.  Here's an
Cheetah-based example of what I'm going on about:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">#from SiteTemplate_ import SiteTemplate_
#from GroupwareWidgets_ import GroupwareWidgets_
#extends SiteTemplate_, GroupwareWidgets_
Surrounding text
$calendarWidget(trans)
Surrounding text
$emailWidget(trans)
Surrounding text
$forumWidget(trans)</pre>
<p>The widgets in the example above should manage their own state and
automatically resolve namespace clashes (of query string/post vars)
among themselves.</p>
<p>-- TavisRudd - 20 Nov 2001</p>
<p>It also involves having some information about what the variables mean
-- for instance, all of the widgets should preserve the
<span class="docutils literal">queryString</span> GET variable (that, say, defines the search results),
but if you have a link on the page that deletes an item with a GET
variable, then other widgets shouldn't preserve that variable in their
generated URLs.  Perhaps this is a matter of seperating variables that
effect the view, and variables that indicate an action to be
performed.  Immediately redirecting after an action may be the best
resolution, now that I think about it, using a <a class="reference external" href="redirectnotify.html">RedirectNotify</a>
pattern.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 20 Nov 2001</p>
<p>That's a great example of why it's better to use POST vars for
performing actions like that.  GET vars are stateful, POST vars are
not.  Once-off actions like deleting something shouldn't be encoded in
the stateful queryString.  Other widgets shouldn't have to know
anything about the GET vars or SESSION vars they aren't using. They
should just preserve them.  This is also an example of where it is
useful for Webware to preserve the GET vars during a POST operation.</p>
<p>-- TavisRudd - 20 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Unfortunately, GET vs. POST is also a UI issue -- you can't do POST
without a FORM element, so you can't do something like &lt;a
href=&quot;?deleteItem=%i&quot;&gt;[delete]&lt;/a&gt; with POST, even though that will
probably be an action (POST-ish).  Blame it on HTML.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 20 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Then use a form instead of a simple link.  It's more verbose on the
HTML side, but to the servlet writer it isn't anything extra if
they're using a well factored library. -- TavisRudd - 25 Nov 2001</p>
<p>You don't get the same interface when you use a form -- forms aren't
well suited to having a large number of divergent options.  For
instance, when showing a table of 50 items, you don't want a submit
button for each delete option.  Unfortunately, good UI dictates you
use links sometimes when POST would be more appropriate from the
server-side perspective.  -- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 25 Nov 2001</p>
<p>You can use Javascript URIs to manipulate a form and get the best of
both worlds. There's also other UI designs that solve this.  Consider
the handling of delete/block in HOTMAIL.  Instead of having a delete
link for each email they use a checkbox selection form and a single
delete button.  -- TavisRudd - 25 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Using Javascript to manipulate and fill forms is very fragile and,
IMHO, very bad style.  I've seen far, far too many broken shopping
carts that relied on Javascript to manipulate the client-side forms
for the benefit of the server-side programmer.  The client in web
programming is a given -- there are some things that can only be done
(well) on the client side, but you should _never_ have the client side
make up for problems of the server-side architecture.  Using POST and
GET to indicate functional differences in variables is imposing
server-side needs where they aren't appropriate.  I think
<a class="reference external" href="redirectnotify.html">RedirectNotify</a> provides the safety of POST (or even better!) while
being more general.  Leave the POST/GET decision to the UI and
graphical designer, and implement new ideas with new (orthogonal)
techniques -- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 25 Nov 2001</p>
<p>I agree about Javascript being fragile when you have non-programmers
fiddling with the code, but I'm thinking in terms of simple UI
'widgets' that the non-programmers can insert in the page with a
single statement in Cheetah.  The non-programmers would never touch
the Javascript. With <a class="reference external" href="redirectnotify.html">RedirectNotify</a> I can't think of anyway that
would work.  Your argument implies that client-side <a class="reference external" href="formvalidation.html">form validation</a>
javascript is 'very bad style'. I disagree. -- TavisRudd - 26 Nov
2001</p>
<p>Not the form validation, but I get the impression you are talking
about something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">&lt;form action=&quot;deleteItem&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; name=&quot;delForm&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;itemID&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript_&quot;&gt;&lt;--
function delItem(itemID) {
    document.forms.delForm.itemID.value = itemID;
    document.forms.delForm.submit();
}
//--&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

to delete: &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:delItem(1)&quot;&gt;[delete]&amp;lt/a&gt;</pre>
<p>That's the kind of Javascript I find to be particularly fragile.  When
the Javascript is necessary to get the UI you want, then yeah, you
have to use it, but that's something else.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 26 Nov 2001</p>
<p>That's what I meant, but I should clarify that I've never had to use
that style and don't think it would be necessary with the style of UI
'widget' that I'm thinking of.  Even if that style was neccessary for
a particular 'widget' I don't see why it would be fragile, as the
'widget' would autogenerate all the HTML and Javascript code related
to it.  There's nothing to be broken.  In other contexts I'd agree
with you, but not when it's autogenerated. -- TavisRudd - 26 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Actually, come to think of it, there are several ways of handling
actions with just GET vars in the QUERY_STRING that don't require
<a class="reference external" href="redirectnotify.html">RedirectNotify</a>.  The simplest would be to just drop any GET var that
contains the word 'action' when rebuilding the URI.  That might cause
problems if you were mixing these 'widgets/components' in with other
systems, but you could get around that by adding a prefix specific to
this UI system.  Another approach would be to make each
'widget/component' remember what action it performed last and to
ignore requests for it to be repeated.  And there's other ways ...</p>
<p>What I'm getting at is that an interface to a 'component/widget'
should be atomic: it shouldn't rely on external servlets.  On the
other hand, forwarding from one servlet to another might make sense in
a complex transactional process like order processing.</p>
<p>To flesh out the GUI analogy a bit more:
* a collection of related servlets == an application
* a servlet == a form, a dialogue, or the main application window
* a 'component' == a widget (stock or custom)</p>
<p>-- TavisRudd - 26 Nov 2001</p>
<p>If the widget is to be atomic, would it preclude items suchs as login
boxes.  This would contain 2 label, and 2 txtbox widgets, but is
itself a widget.</p>
<p>Couldn't FFK be expanded to encompass this?</p>
