<p>Cofax, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cofax.org/">http://www.cofax.org/</a> -- is the Java software that powers
Knight-Ridder newspaper web sites, like <a class="reference external" href="http://inq.philly.com/">http://inq.philly.com/</a>. Very
cool, professional stuff.</p>
<p>But it's Java. It needs to be ported to Webware.</p>
<p>Cofax uses a lot of 3rd party libraries, which have Python
equivalents, and if you abstract out the servlet and connection and
caching stuff (much of which is duplicated by Webware, or will be
eventually), what you're left with is a pretty manageable port.</p>
<p>One thing that could stand upgrading is the template system Cofax
uses; I'd prefer to use NITF (the news industry's XML vocabulary) and
XSLT, but Cheetah should be available too.</p>
<p>I'm very interested in building these kinds of sites, since I pretend
to be a Web publisher most of the time, so I'd be interested in
working actively with folks on a port.</p>
