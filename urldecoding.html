<h1 class="title">URL Decoding</h1>

<p><em>Some ideas on things that I'd like to see Webware allow with URL
decoding:</em></p>
<p>I'd like to be able to join two directories -- one which contains
servlets, and one with contains static pages or perhaps Cheetah
templates.  A nonprogrammer would then be insulated from documents
which would be dangerous to edit (Python code).</p>
<p>I'd like to properly represent abstract objects (like database
objects).  I can do this with <a class="reference external" href="extrapathinfo.html">extraPathInfo</a> now, but the caching
doesn't work as I'd want -- I have to recreate the servlet each time
on awake(), when if the servlets were cached according to that
<a class="reference external" href="extrapathinfo.html">extraPathInfo</a> (or something like that), then I'd only have to set
things up in <span class="docutils literal">__init__</span>.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to modify settings based on the path of the URL.
For instance, .html files in some paths might need to go through a
processor that wraps them in a template -- in other paths they might
be presented verbatim.  In some paths, errors should be emailed to me,
in other paths they should be displayed immediately.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to better be able to resolve conflicts between
extensions.  Specifically, I'd like to be able to say that .tmpl files
override .py files.</p>
<p>I'd like to do positional arguments before the servlet -- perhaps
fragile, but also traditional and a bit more compact.</p>
<p>Somewhat like mod_speling, I'd like to have case-insentive URLs and
I'd like to have spell checking in the URLs -- including spell
checking on non-filesystem arguments (positional URL arguments both
prefixing and following the servlet name).</p>
<p>I'd like to have enough introspection to create a sitemap directly,
as well as indexes and the like.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to represent arbitrary URL mappings, ala
mod_rewrite.</p>
<p>Do the thing that Zope does, where when you should have a url like
/path/to/something and it should be /path/to/something/, see if the
servlet can handle that on its own (by putting a BASE HREF in the
output), or if you should do a client redirect, or if you should just
ignore it (for instance, if you are serving a non-href-aware type of
document).</p>
<p>Virtual domains.  These are mostly like prefix contexts/variables.</p>
<p>Many of these are possible with some mod_rewrite magic.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I <em>don't</em> think that Application should support all of these -- quite
the contrary.  I'd like to see a system that gives all the <em>hooks</em>
necessary to do these sorts of things.  I'd like a less centralized
algorithm -- much shorter than what is currently there.</p>
<p>The one things that I <em>don't</em> particularly want is fully dynamic URL
mapping -- I'm fine with indefinitely caching the results of a URL
decoding.  Those results won't necessarily be a filename, but they'll
be something.</p>
