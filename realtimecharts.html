<h1 class="title">Real-time Charts</h1>

<p>Many applications need to present data using charts and graphs. There
seems to be a scarcity of good Open Source Python charting libraries.</p>
<p>Please add any solution and experiences you have with it here.</p>

<h1>JpGraph</h1>
<p>Sean True of WebReply, Inc. ported JpGraph to Python. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/">JpGraph</a> is a
substantial presentation graphics module written in PHP by Johan
Persson. Sean wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;JpGraph is a fully OO graph library which makes it easy to both draw
a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; graph with a minimum of code and quite complex
graphs which requires a very fine grain of control. The library tries
to assign sensible default values for most parameters hence making the
learning curve quite flat since for most of the time very few commands
is required to draw graphs with a pleasing aesthetic look.&quot; -- Johan
Persson</p>
<p>Our port of JpGraph depends on gdmodule, and of gd itself. Both are
included in the tar file. The port also expects Freetype and
appropriate TTF fonts, which are not included. Gantt charts and image
maps still need work, but the package in general pretty well. Sample
output is available from the download site.</p>
<p>Download from <a class="reference external" href="http://metagram.webreply.com">http://metagram.webreply.com</a></p>
<p>Note that the PHP version of JpGraph is licensed under the QPL 1.0 (Qt
Free Licensee) for non-commercial, open-source and educational use and
JpGraph Professional License for commercial or proprietary use. What
this means for the Python port is an open question.</p>

<p>ChartDirector looks very similar to JpGraph, but is from

<h1>Comment</h1>
<p>The package seems to be easy to use, and the licensing cost seems
reasonable. However, the lack of source code is worrying given what
can happen to companies.</p>

<div class="section" id="dislin">
<h1>DISLIN</h1>
<p>From the DISLIN homepage: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linmpi.mpg.de/dislin/">http://www.linmpi.mpg.de/dislin/</a></p>
<p>DISLIN is a high-level plotting library for displaying data as curves,
polar plots, bar graphs, pie charts, 3D-color plots, surfaces,
contours and maps.</p>
<p>DISLIN is intended to be a powerful and easy to use software package
for scientists and programmers. There are only a few graphics routines
with a short parameter list needed to display the desired graphical
output. A large variety of parameter setting routines can then be
called to create individually customized graphics.</p>
<p>DISLIN is free for the operating systems Linux and FreeBSD and for the
MS-DOS and Windows compilers GCC, G77 and LCC. The DISLIN plotting
extensions for Java, Python and Perl and the DISLIN interpreter DISGCL
can be used freely on all operating systems. Other DISLIN versions are
available at low prices and can be tested free of charge.</p>

<div class="section" id="id3">
<h1>Comment</h1>
<p>The charts that DISLIN generates favors correct, scientific
presentation over incorrect business presentation (which often
distorts the interpretation of the underlying data). This means it wil
l do amazing graphs, but not flashy ones.</p>
<p>The Python interface seems awkward to use.</p>

<div class="section" id="mayavi">
<h1>MayaVi</h1>
<p>Prabhu Ramachandran, author of <a class="reference external" href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/index.html">MayaVi</a> writes:</p>
<p>MayaVi is a free, easy to use scientific data visualizer. It is
written in Python and uses the amazing Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for
the graphics. It provides a GUI written using Tkinter. MayaVi is free
and distributed under the conditions of the BSD license. It is also
cross platform and should run on any platform where both Python and
VTK are available (which is almost any *nix, Mac OSX or Windows).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h1>Comment</h1>
<p>An intriguing data visualizer written in Python, so it should feel
right to Pythonistas. This looks easier to use than DISLIN. The
documentation looks excellent (so far), and the license looks right.</p>

<div class="section" id="reportlab">
<h1>ReportLab</h1>
<p>ReportLab includes a charting package. It is easy to use and very complete.
The charts are not as fancy as the commercial options outlined above,
but I actually like them better at this point. Open source in Python too.</p>
