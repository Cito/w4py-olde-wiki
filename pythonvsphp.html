<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Every month or so someone posts to comp.lang.python asking how Python
compares to PHP.  Python's 'language comparisons' page doesn't have an
entry for PHP so here's a first draft.  This work-in-progress compares
PHP and Python and evaluates their relative strengths for web
development.</p>
<p>Please contribute! Once there's some flesh on this skeleton, I'll tidy
it up and submit it to: <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/doc/Comparisons.html">http://python.org/doc/Comparisons.html</a></p>

<h1>Common Ground</h1>
<p>Both PHP and Python:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>are interpreted, high level languages with dynamic typing</p></li>
<li><p>are full programming languages, rather than specifically &quot;for the web&quot; languages.</p></li>
<li><p>are OpenSource (except PHP's ZEND engine?)</p></li>
<li><p>are supported by large developer communities</p></li>
<li><p>are easy to learn (compared to Java, and even Perl)</p></li>
<li><p>are easy to extend in C, C++ and Java</p></li>
<li><p>are extremely portable. They run on almost all platforms in
existence without recompilation.</p></li>
<li><p>support for variable number of function arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>have the ability to freeze live objects in a string representation
(for storing arbitrary objects on disk, moving them over the
network, etc); they can then be converted back to identical objects
with data intact.  PHP's serialize function; Python's pickle and
marshal modules.  Note that PHP, handling of serialized objects and
classes is much weakier and error prone than Python's due to PHP's
lack of modules.  When an object is serialized, only its attributes
are stored, not its methods.  Thus, the object's class must be
present (with the exact same name) in the script that unserializes
it.  In Python this is handled automatically via the module/import
framework. <em>(this COULD be handled with PHP 5's __autoload(), but is not done automatically)</em></p></li>
<li><p>lack strict boolean conditionals (strings and numerals are considered valid conditional statements)</p></li>

<li><p>script-global variable protection (script-global variables must be imported by a function before they can be used)</p></li>
<li><p>class-global variable protection (class-global variables must be indicated as $this-&gt;varname, $varname variables are local scope)</p></li>

<div class="section" id="what-does-python-have-that-php-doesn-t">

<div class="section" id="compared-as-web-development-frameworks">
<h2>Compared as Web Development Frameworks</h2>
<p>Unlike PHP, which has web development features built directly into the
core language, Python's web development capabilites are provided by
add-on modules.  Basic CGI capabilities are provided by the 'cgi'
module which comes in Python's standard library.  There's also a wide
range of third-party modules available for Python; some are
complementary, others compete.  As a result, Python provides a more
flexible base for web development.</p>
<p>There are some adverse side effects of this flexibility. First, the
range of choices can be bewildering. Unless you are working
experienced Python web developers, PHP is easier to get started with.
Second, support for PHP is more common with shared-hosting companies
than support for the various Python options.</p>
<p>Another difference is that PHP is embedded in the web server, whereas
Python web applications can either be embedded in the web server like
PHP or run in a separate process.  Here's a simple classification of
Python web development platforms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>emdedded in the web server process</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Apache modules <span class="docutils literal">mod_python</span> and <span class="docutils literal">mod_snake</span> embed the Python
interpreter in Apache and allow other Apache modules to be written
with Python.  This is the same idea as <span class="docutils literal">mod_perl</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>PyWX is an extension to AOLServer that serves the same purpose as
the Apache modules above.</p></li>
<li><p>MS ASP scripts can be written using Python via <em>Active Scripting
Host</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>running in a separate process</p>
<ul>
<li><p>non-persistent process (a new process is spawned for each request)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>custom CGI scripts</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>persistent process (all requests are sent from the web server to
one persistent process, sometimes via a CGI wrapper)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>custom Fast-CGI scripts</p></li>
<li><p>custom SCGI scripts</p></li>
<li><p>custom WSGI modules</p></li>
<li><p>'Application Servers'</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="zope.html">Zope</a> -- comes with its own web server
but can also communicate with Apache via the CGI
or Fast-CGI protocols.</p></li>
<li><p>Webware -- works with any web server via CGI.  With Apache it
can communicate via a custom Fast-CGI like protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>SkunkWeb -- only works with Apache, communicates via a custom
Fast-CGI like protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- WSGI: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/ -->
<p>(Note: PHP programs <em>can</em> be run standalone or as ordinary CGI
scripts.  However, when called indirectly from the web (e.g., from a
Perl CGI script), it requires unsetting an undocumented number of web
environment variables so that PHP doesn't think it's running from the
web and look in the wrong place for the script. Likewise, it's
_possible_ to write a long-running server in PHP, but there are
precious few examples of it.)</p>
<p>The vast majority of Python web applications are run in a separate
process. This has some important implications. ... to be continued ...</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<h2>Core Documentation</h2>
<p>Although both PHP and Python have excellent core documentation,
Python's is more extensive and generally higher quality. PHP has a
large number of translations available.  Python doesn't. For PHP see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.php.net/docs.php">http://www.php.net/docs.php</a> and for Python see <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/doc/">http://python.org/doc/</a>
Python allows documentation on modules, classes, and functions to be
included in the program code. The documentation becomes an attribute
of the module/class/function, accessible from inside of the language
itself. <em>(This is so untrue. Python  docs are short and don't explain
in detail how something can or should be used. PHP uses examples (L.B.E.).
PHP has comments on every page so you can check for someone that tried
to do the same thing you did. PHP can be documented just like many other
languages like C for example; http://www.phpdoc.org/ )</em></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>it is not up to the rest of us to tell you which programming language to favour. Learn both, and learn which to use when. If you find out you end up using PHP or Python more than the other, then you know which programming language works best for you. If the job you need to get done relies on specific features that are available to one, but not the other, then there is no choice to make, go with the one that offers this feature.</p>

<div class="section" id="frequently-asked-questions">
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><em>Q1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>... what is the best way to build web-based database applications
like accounting systems, on Python? i.e. what is the equivalent of
ASP pages or PHP pages or JSP pages, for Python??  Shouldn't we be
learning THAT instead of PHP???</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A1</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no simple answer to this question.  There are many tools
available for doing this in Python.  So many that the choices can
be bewildering.  You're best to think of the tools as falling into
two complementary categories: Application Servers (there's
probably a better term to use here) and Template Engines.</p>

<h1>General Discussion</h1>
<p>(add your comments here, along with a signature and date)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I haven't used PHP with XML, and I've only used Python with XML a
little, but I get the impression Python is much better suited --
specifically because it is strongly types, where PHP is rather weak in
its typing (like C).  But I can't say from experience</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 26 Nov 2001</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>To clarify, PHP's types are <em>more</em> dynamic than Python's.  All
variables are automatically initialized to NULL.  It automatically
converts between strings, numbers and NULL when a different type is
needed for the operation, or with a type case.  It also &quot;does
something&quot; to convert to/from array and object.  '123' -&gt; 123,
'non-numeric' -&gt; 0, NULL -&gt; '', etc.  Sometimes all this is
convenient, especially when a missing CGI param converts to NULL which
converts to '' in the VALUE= attribute, but it also leads to wrong
ouput rather than errors if you misspell a variable or key.</p>
<p>PHP does not have first-class functions.  There are equivalents to
Python's map, reduce, filter, and there's array_walk, but they all
take the name of a function rather than the function itself.</p>
<p>Examples of PHP's schizophrenic function naming: (string functions)
stripslashes vs strip_tags; (array functions) array_keys vs asort vs
count and shuffle; (variable functions etc) isset vs is_array.</p>
<p>PHP has constants, which are initialized with a totally different
syntax than variable assignment.  The advantage of constants is that
they can be defined only once, allowing you to define sensitive
constants in a secure include file, then prevent untrusted code from
overriding them.  Constants are global: they bypass the scoping rules.
One disadvantage is that a constant is a bare word: if you misspell
it, you'll silently get a NULL value.</p>
<p>Syntax errors show the file and line number, but not the character
position.  Sometimes the error message is specific, sometimes just
&quot;parse error&quot;.  This leads to staring at the code for a while until
you realize you're missing '$' or ';', or you put something besides a
semicolon on the END line matching &lt;&lt;&lt;END .</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="mikeorr.html">MikeOrr</a> - 15 Dec 2001</p>
<p>This document has become rather old. With PHP 5.2.x and Python 3.0 out,
and almost 10 years after this document was first drafted, it has become
clear that, from the perspective of a person who intends to use these
languages, the choice between them is essentially arbitrary. For
trivial tasks it is irrelevant which is being used (because then it's not
a choice between PHP or Python, but between every programming language
for which there are compilers and interpreters available), and for complex
tasks more often than not someone has already done what you need in both
PHP and Python, as well as typically in Perl and Ruby.</p>
<p>Also, do not be taken in by trivial differences: Python's indented scoping
vs. PHP's explicit scoping is only syntactic sugar: the transformation from
one method of scoping to the other is the most basic of trivial
transformations, and if you want you can set up your interpreter so that it
always runs your script through that transformation before executing, so you
can code PHP with indentation scoping, or Python with curly braces.</p>
<p>Python's use of module imports rather than PHP's code inclusion is a strong
argument to use Python in structured complex situations, but careful
programming and using project-specific conventions (and sticking to them)
will achieve the same in a PHP project (although you won't find a single
experienced programmer out there who will not tell you that modules and
packages are a cleaner, and easier to debug approach).</p>
<p>With IDEs such as Eclipse offering plugins do PHP as well as Python development,
the IDE availability argument is also moot. As ever, the conclusion must
necessarily be: use the language that gets the job done best, in the least
amount of time, with the least amount of debugging. Everything PHP can do,
Python can do, and vice versa; you want to select your language based on how
they behave when things  <em>don't</em> work. Is it easier to debug a PHP application
or a Python application? No one knows, actually, because a well designed
application doesn't break, and a poorly designed application is as poor as
the programmer's oversight.</p>
