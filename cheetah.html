<p><strong>Cheetah</strong> is a Python-powered template engine and code generator.  It
can be used as a standalone utility or it can be combined with other
tools.  Cheetah has many potential uses, but web developers looking
for a viable alternative to ASP, JSP, PHP and PSP are expected to be
its principle user group.</p>
<p>Cheetah:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>generates HTML, SGML, XML, SQL, Postscript, form email, LaTeX,
or any other text-based format.</p></li>
<li><p>cleanly separates content, graphic design, and program code.  This
leads to highly modular, flexible, and reusable site architectures;
faster development time; and HTML and program code that is easier to
understand and maintain. It is particularly well suited for team
efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>blends the power and flexibility of Python with a simple template
language that non-programmers can understand.</p></li>
<li><p>gives template writers full access to any Python data structure,
module, function, object, or method in their templates.</p></li>
<li><p>makes code reuse easy by providing an object-orientated interface to
templates that is accessible from Python code or other Cheetah
templates.  One template can subclass another and selectively
reimplement sections of it.</p></li>
<li><p>provides a simple, yet powerful, caching mechanism that can
dramatically improve the performance of a dynamic website.</p></li>
<li><p>compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cheetah integrates tightly with <strong>Webware for Python</strong>
(<a class="reference external" href="http://webwareforpython.org">http://webwareforpython.org</a>): a Python-powered application server and
persistent servlet framework. Webware provides automatic session,
cookie, and user management and can be used with almost any
operating-system, web server, or database. Through Python, it works
with XML, SOAP, XML-RPC, CORBA, COM, DCOM, LDAP, IMAP, POP3, FTP, SSL,
etc.. Python supports structured exception handling, threading, object
serialization, unicode, string internationalization, advanced
cryptography, and more. It can also be extended with code and
libraries written in C, C++, Java and other languages.</p>
<p>Like Python, Cheetah and Webware are Open Source Software and are
supported by active user communities.  Together, they are a powerful
and elegant framework for building dynamic web sites.</p>
<p>Like its namesake, Cheetah is fast, flexible and powerful.</p>
