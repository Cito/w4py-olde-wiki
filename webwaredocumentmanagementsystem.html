<h1 class="title">Webware Document Management System</h1>

<p>This would be interelated to nearly everything else.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-ideas">
<h1>Basic Ideas</h1>
<p>The main object would be a <em>document</em>. This contains the actual text
(or file), some information how to render the text and, most
important, some <em>attribute</em> information. An <em>attribute</em> would be a
basic meta information about the document.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example. We want store documents about
software. Basic attributes would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>operating system</p></li>
<li><p>vendor</p></li>
<li><p>product (name of the software)</p></li>
<li><p>modul (if it's not a trivial software)</p></li>
<li><p>version</p></li>
<li><p>information category (getting started, installation, tips and tricks,...)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these attributes are related to each other while others are
not. If I have for example a product, I have already the vendor (Word
-- &gt; Microsoft). This leads to a hierachical structure:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">operating system

vendor
     |---product
     |---module
     |---version

information category</pre>
<p>Every of these attributes can have several instances
* operating system: Win98, Linux, ...
* vendor: Microsoft, RedHat, ...
* ...</p>
<p>All of this should be configurable via the web interface. This is
exactly where I've seen some Document Management Systems fail: the
attributes are hardcoded or, even if you can change something, it is
not possible to introduce a hierachy of attributes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<h1>Usage</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>documents can be browsed via the attributes or searched via a search engine.</p></li>
<li><p>documents can be converted on the fly (XML/XSLT --&gt; HTML)</p></li>
<li><p>documents can be exported on the fly (XML/XSLT --&gt; PDF)</p></li>
<li><p>batch import/export of documents</p></li>
<li><p>revision management</p></li>
<li><p>check out of documents</p></li>
<li><p>integrated workflow management?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This might be enough for a start and some dicussion. Please feel free to add your ideas.</p>

<p>Small point on the &quot;exported on the fly&quot;.  Currently the best way to
go from XML style documents to PDF, is utilizing FO documents, and
process them with FOP ( A java tool ). [ Purely my opinion RL ]</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">http://xml.apache.org/fop/</a></p>
<p>I haven't found an XML:FO option to reportlab, they do support some
XML style tags inline of their flowables ( specifically their
Paragraph one ).  I'm looking into it to see how best to extend that.
If possible tie it into a cheetah template like structure ... and push
out some PDF.</p>
<p>Second small point &quot;documents can converted&quot;.  That implies utilizing
XML as the basis of the document structure, and utilizing XSLT
transformation via 4Suite, or some such.  I would recommend possibly
distributing the load for something like this via <a class="reference external" href="xmlrpc.html">XmlRpc</a>, and
utilizing a Java / Xalan engine for the transformation.  I'm looking
into the same for the XML/XSLT to PDF translation utilizing FOP, and
<a class="reference external" href="xmlrpc.html">XmlRpc</a>.</p>
<p>It could allow for a more scalable system architecture, even though it
would probably slow the responsiveness of the system.</p>
<p>Having said all of the above.  I find working with Cheetah / Webware /
Python substantially faster ( for me! ), in development.  I came from
Taglibs / JSP ( Tomcat / WebLogic / JRun ) / XML ( XSP via Cocoon ) /
Java.  Personal preference is to stick with Cheetah / Webware template
applications, spitting out reportlab PDF ... but hey they can't (
currently ) support your request of XML to PDF, or XML to HTML, but I
find it easier to work with Cheetah templates than XML / XSLT
transformations.  Personal preference only.</p>

<p>The reason I'd like to use XML is to be independent from any
application in order to create the documents outside the management
system and do whatever I want with them.  I've played around with
4suite. It's quite easy to use but seems to be a little slow. A non
python xslt processor might give better results in that area.  Another
way to produce PDF is going via LaTeX. It looks quite promising but is
really not usable for &quot;on the fly&quot; processing.</p>
<p>Anyway, to be able to preprocess the files before sending to the
browser is central. Another example that comes to mind is the usage of
Wiki pages (see <a class="reference external" href="webwarewiki.html">WebwareWiki</a>): strcutured test --&gt; html via a wiki
parser.</p>
<p>-- StephanDiehl - 22 Nov 2001 &lt;br/&gt;</p>
<p>Couldn't we just use Cheetah to generate templated XML exports?  It's
what I was thinking to create the XML for the xalan based
transformations.  Just a thought.</p>
<p>-- RayLeyva - 22 Nov 2001</p>
<p>If it works, why not? I wouldn't want to force to anybody anyway to
use something specific. There should be some configurable filetype
handler. So, in the case of XML, the admin should decide, if he is
using a xslt processor, some css stylesheet, Cheetah, or whatever
works best for the situation.</p>
<p>-- StephanDiehl - 22 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Perhaps we can use the term &quot;property&quot; or &quot;attribute&quot; rather than
&quot;category&quot;.  The word &quot;category&quot; normally means a group the document
is &quot;in&quot;.  In other words, it's the <em>value</em> of a certain property, not
the property itself.  The category may also be expressed above the
doucment; e.g., the directory the document is in.  This encourages
users to think of the document as being in a certain hierarchical
location.  But putting the category name in a property allows for
easier sorting/searching (sort by any property, search for all
documents matching a certain property value).  Which is better depends
on the application.  But in any case, using the term category for
property is confusing.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="mikeorr.html">MikeOrr</a> - 22 Nov 2001</p>
<p>Agreed. This makes a lot of sense. I wasn't too happy about
&quot;category&quot;, but couldn't think of anything better. From now on I'll
use <em>attribute</em>.</p>

<p>Here are a bunch of wishlist items for a content management system
(CMS): <a class="reference external" href="webwaredocumentmanagementsystemmso1.html">WebwareDocumentManagementSystemMSO1</a>.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="mikeorr.html">MikeOrr</a> - 15 Apr 2002</p>
<p>I think RDF would probably give a good framework for document
classification.</p>
<p>The backend storage has to be in native format -- not XML.  If you
demand that everything be converted to XML, you'll lose information in
the process and not be able to retrieve it later -- especially
annoying if you try to retrieve the original content and get something
slightly different back.</p>
<p>To do this, you might rank every sort of conversion and find the
shortest path from the original document format to the target document
format, probably caching various formats while you're at it.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="ianbicking.html">IanBicking</a> - 15 Apr 2002</p>
<p>About XML transformations, performance and so on: 4Suite isn't the
only option for XSLT - there's a wrapper around Xalan as well as
libxslt (and libxml2), although those packages may not be compliant
with the XML-SIG API.</p>
<p>-- <a class="reference external" href="paulboddie.html">PaulBoddie</a> - 16 Apr 2002</p>
<p>We're using the Apache stuff in a separate process (i.e.,
os.system(...)) to generate PDFs from XML that we build using
Cheetah. It's not the fastest in the world, but it's functional. I'm
planning on updating it and bypassing the XML step, having the XSLT
engine call directly into our object model, which saves the XML export
and the subsequent XML parse steps. I'll report back on my experiences
when I finish that :)</p>
<p>(PS: I haven't read closely enough to determine how much actual
forward motion there's been on the Webware CMS. Anyway, in case it's
relevant, we (<a class="reference external" href="http://hfd.com/">HFD</a> ) are &quot;most likely&quot; going to release our content
management product (built on Webware) under an Open Source license by
the end of 2003. I say &quot;most likely&quot; because we're all generally
agreed that it's what we want to do, but we have to iron out the
details, and I don't want to make a concrete statement without having
concrete under me :) (PPS: Chuck, Geoff, the Monkey's grown up a lot
since you last saw him :) ))</p>
