Ideas for future Improvement
----------------------------

Some things I have in mind, though it's very unsure when and if ever:

* Templating (configurable on a per-domain basis).
  Probably with Cheetah_.
  Choosable in some fashion as well, particularly a "printable" template.

* More Indexing (backlinks are indexed)

* More configuration options to control output and suppress links.

* Mail notification on changes (though we have RSS now)

* Some sort of categorization (maybe with more metadata; keyword
  metadata, or a more controlled form of categorization)

* InterWiki-links

* Locking of pages for editing

* `Related terms`_ starts the idea, but it needs a lot more flushing
  out; more on that page.

* Look at http://www.mnot.net/python/RSS.py , see if it should
  replace ``rsspersist.py``

* Maybe something with Atom, like described in
  http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/04/14/atomwiki.html

* Make implicit user logins -- with cookie or by IP address -- by user
  preference.

* Allow for deleting and moving pages.  I'm thinking this would be
  implemented with a new page type, application/x-redirect, and with
  deletes.  A rename or move would be a copy, delete, replace with
  redirect.

* Give untitled links titles by fetching the target and looking for a
  ``<title>``.  Maybe part of restructured text parsing, and an
  addition to the WYSIWYG editor, or maybe a post-processing filter.

* Referrer tracking. Accept trackbacks (as comments?).

* Many RSS (or whatever format) files.  One for each page (just append
  ``.rss``).  One for each user?  One for site as well.

* Note the many features on this page:
  http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/IdeasToPlace and
  also:
  http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/FeatureSummaries
  specifically...

* `Fading Links`_: links change color depending on how often they are
  followed.  Rates not just popularity of a page, but popularity of a
  connection.

* `Automatic Translation`_. Nice because it's easy.

* `Email Address Protection`_. Or, more generally, pluggable output
  filters.  In this case, a little Javascript "encryption".

* `Fine Grained Addressing`_. This is like `Purple Number`_.
  This could be added fairly easily to ``text/html`` content, but
  restructured text will be harder.

* `Event Casting`_, i.e., some sort of remote event notification.
  Perhaps also trackback pings to all newly created links.

* Obscure links behind redirects, like described here__.  But only
  "unapproved" links -- i.e., new links.  (Note, we are already
  telling search engines not to index the sandbox pages, which are
  most prone to these abuses.)  IP tracking and banning might also go
  with this.  Revert+ban (block IP, delete user account) would be
  convenient, but it isn't that bad yet.

* Boilerplate pages.  There's a number of pages (growing) related to
  instructions about the Wiki.  When the Wiki starts up, it should
  automatically install any new pages (pages that are listed in the
  boilerplate, but aren't on the site).

* Put templates, embedded content (e.g., navigation text), CSS into
  Wiki.

* Locking or edit conflict detection.

* Links to pages that don't exist would pass the content of the anchor,
  so that we have a decent idea of what the title should look like.

* Attachments. Archives would be spiffy too -- download the archive,
  or view the archive contents (maybe just a listing).  Serve as a
  simple code repository.  (Single Python scripts are already
  supported well enough.)

* Permissions.  Restrict editing, creation, commenting based on roles,
  assign roles.

* Display entire page in RSS when a page is created.  If no log
  message on an edit, include some sort of abbreviated diff.

* `Machine Readable Pages`_.  I.e., an XMLRPC_ interface.  Should be
  easy, but I'm not sure how many interesting clients there are.

* `Near Links`_.  This might mean tracking the available pages in
  several wikis, and noting similarities in page names (either
  matches, or near matches, like `Like Pages`_).

Anything related to the markup should be put into docutils -- I think
wiki links are nearly all we need in the way of extensions; everything
else can be done in docutils directly.  (Though perhaps there should
be a general directive, which simply passes parameters to the Wiki to
be rendered at display time)

Requested Features
------------------

Put whatever you want here.

* Possibility to generate static pages for fast and scalable read-only
  with any server. *request granted*

* Breadcrumb links (showing your recent path through the wiki)

  IB: What's the value over the back button?

  CG: Well, if you click back then click a link, it erases the forward history,
  so it's handy for that. I don't think I described it right -- it's more of
  a static-length page history with most recently visited pages at the top
  (and when you visit a page in that history, it pushes it back up to the top).
  It lets you do non-linear history traversal. :) It's not really THAT useful,
  but MoinMoin has it, and I find that it comes in handy when you want to go
  back and forth between two wikipages that aren't linked directly to each other.
  Plus, it's prominently visible, so you can quickly jump back 5 pages with ease!

* Petition the docutils guys to make their formatting warning messages include
  a piece (or the whole) line that generated the error. ;)

* Javascript function that clears the "click here to search..." field when you
  select it. (IB: it's supposed to do that now; works for me on Mozilla at least)

* ReST Quick-Reference link on editing page (popup window)

More ideas
----------

Things I don't really have in mind, but maybe would be a good idea:

* Macros, like in MoinMoin_ -- would replace custom pages
  (like `recent changes`_)

* User preferences

* Transclusion (including the contents of one page in another;
  maybe it would be important with binary pages)

* Internationalization (I have so little in-code text now, it would be
  both easy and uninteresting)

* Blog-like top-comment mode

* Workflow.  Cool, but hard.  Note `Staged Commits`_.
