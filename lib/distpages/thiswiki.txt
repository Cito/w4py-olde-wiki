Markup
------

This wiki uses `ReStructuredText`_ for its markup.  Restructured
text is intended as a general-purpose markup for creating documents,
with specific emphasis on documenting programming.  As such it is the
perfect fit for this site.  ReStructuredText is also used by several
other projects, so if you learn how to use it for this wiki you can
transfer that knowledge other places.

.. _ReStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

To learn how to use ReStructuredText, you may wish to look at the
`Quick Reference`_

.. _Quick Reference: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/rst/quickref.html

Note that WikiNames are *not* used in this software!  Instead a ``_``
must be appended to a name to make it into a link, and use::

    `Long wiki name`_

for multi-word names.  All names are made lower-case and spaces are
replaced with hyphens (i.e., the link is to the page ``long-wiki-name.html``).

To play around with the markup to this wiki feel free to use the `Wiki Sandbox`_.

External Editor
---------------

If you don't want to use ``textarea`` editing (which is no fun), this
site uses `External Editor`_ to allow text to be edited with a
standard text editor.  The Zope Product aspect is not required (the
equivalent is already built into this wiki), but the "helper
application" is used to hook into the editor.  This is
the ``zopeedit.py`` application.  To invoke the editor once you have
set up the client, click the pen image (|penimage|).  This is highly
recommended -- client installation is easy, available for multiple
platforms, and the editing experience is far superior.

If you are using a browser in the Mozilla family (Mozilla, Firefox,...) you can
also use the cool `Mozex`_ extension, which lets you configure your favourite
text editor (Emacs, Vim, Notepad,...) for textareas.

WYSIWYG Editor
--------------

For editing HTML pages directly in WYSIWYG fashion, this wiki uses Xinha.
This should work out of the box with all modern web browsers supporting
Javascript. You will even get a special button for Wiki internal links.

Other Notes
-----------

Updates to this site are published to a `New Pages`_ and a `Recent Changes`_
RSS feed, which you can subscribe to in order to receive updates.
