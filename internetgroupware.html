<p><em>SourceForge.net provides a valuable service to the Open Source
community, but its implementation and user interface could be improved
in many ways</em>.  (TavisRudd in <a class="reference external" href="webwaresourceforge.html">WebwareSourceforge</a>)</p>
<p>The biggest improvement would be to get the browser out of the way. I
cringe every time I need to search a mailing list (or worse, a
Sourceforge &quot;forum&quot;) for a specific keyword or conversation through
some strange web-interface. IMAP, which was designed for exactly that
purpose, does the job thousands of times faster with far less drain on
both human and computer/network resources. (NNTP is also ok, but
requires the <em>client</em> software to do the searching, thus causing
<em>more</em> load on the server by having to transfer all of the articles,
rather than just the interesting ones.)</p>
<p>I think that a key benefit of the webware approach over the Zope
approach is that you can design your application without being
constrained by a browser.  Roundup's design is a good example of
this. It uses the most approriate protocol/tool for each task,
instead of trying to shoehorn everything into &quot;stateless&quot; HTTP
transactions.</p>
<p>Therefore: a &quot;webware application&quot; such as this proposed collaboration
suite, should be first an <em>application</em> with a <em>thin</em> adapter to
create a browser-based UI generated using webware components.</p>

<p>(Can you tell that I <em>strongly dislike</em> web-only interfaces? 8-D)</p>
