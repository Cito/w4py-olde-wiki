<p>a Parnassus-like site, not just using <a class="reference external" href="webkit.html">WebKit</a>'s base features, but
also using some of the other kits and extensions</p>

<p>If we were to enable user comments via an integrated Wiki this could
become immensely useful, and popular!  This would allow the index of
listed software to be matched up with user reviews and also more
general discussions about specific 'problem domains'.  It might even
become THE Wiki for Python related discussion.  Furthermore, if it was
combined with <a class="reference external" href="webwarelistarchive.html">WebwareListArchive</a> serving the main Python lists, you'd
have an even more useful site.  Imagine, being able to easily link
Wiki discussions and discussions on the list.  The interface to
<a class="reference external" href="webwarelistarchive.html">WebwareListArchive</a> could auto-link WikiNames.  We could also provide
some simple syntax for linking to postings from the Wiki topics.
Finally, it would also be nice to have a quick syntax for linking to
sections in the main Python docs.</p>
<p>I guess it would compete with <a class="reference external" href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/">http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/</a></p>

<p>It could be neat if the archiver would notice an email with WIKI:
SomeWikiName in the subject line, and then generate a Wiki page from
that and all emails that reply.  Later on someone could edit the page
to turn it into something more compact.  It would be even better if
you could put that wiki note into the subject or body later, and it
add all previous messages in that thread as well -- since you don't
always know what threads will be interesting.</p>
<p>The other situation is when someone asks a question that should be
documented.  A good reply will often make for a good basis for
documentation.  There you'd just want to mark a single email as being
destined for the Wiki.</p>
